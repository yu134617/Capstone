  Task Description: Perform risk factor analysis based on risk descriptions (HTML format) from company financial reports, using a specified risk framework.

  Input Parameters:
    - Company Name: {company}
    - Risk Description: {description} (The "risk item" section from the financial report, in HTML format)
    - Risk Framework: {framework}

  Processing Requirements:
    1. Risk Factor Extraction:
      - Extract only bolded headings in the HTML as risk factors. Ignore all other content (e.g., body paragraphs).
  
    2. Risk Matching Rules:
      - Prioritize existing factor names from the risk framework.
      - If no close match exists, generate a new leaf factor and prefix it with `new factor:` (e.g., `new factor: xxx risk` if "xxx risk" is not in the framework).
      - For a single company, limit new factors to fewer than 5 but more than 1. Prioritize matching existing framework factors.
      - Ensure the number of leaf factors matches the count in the report (must be fewer than 20). If exceeded, reprocess until compliant.
      - Preserve the original order of leaf factors as they appear in the report.
    
    3. Output Format:
      - Strictly return standard JSON (no explanatory text).
      - Use a two-level structure: root factor (risk category) → leaf factor (specific risk).
      - Preserve the order of leaf factors (both in count and sequence) as in the original report.
      - Prioritize root factors from the report for categorization.
      - If no root factors exist in the report, derive them autonomously with these rules:
        * Cover all leaf factors while maintaining the original order.
        * Use industry-standard categories (e.g., Market/Operational/Financial/Compliance/Strategic/Geopolitics/Technology Risks).
    
    4. Additional Constraints:
      - Do not alter the original order of risk factors.
      - Keep factor names concise (≤5 English words).

  Example Output Format:
    {
      "Market Risks": ["Demand Decline", "Competition Intensification"],
      "Compliance Risks": ["Policy Change", "Regulatory Adjustment"]
    }
