  Please summarize {company}'s risk factors following these guidelines:
  
  Return them in JSON format. For example:
  ```
  {{
  'root factor A': ['leaf factor A1', 'leaf factor A2', ... ],
  'root factor B': ['leaf factor B1', 'leaf factor B2', ... ]
  }}
  ```
  
  Requirements:
  1. Input Processing:
    - Extract ONLY bold headings as risk factors
    - Completely ignore all body text content
    - Maintain original order of bold headings
  
  2. Output Structure:
    - Strict hierarchical JSON format:
      - Top-level: Standard root factors (Market/Operational/Financial/etc.)
      - Second-level: Leaf factors (extracted bold headings)
    - If no root factors exist, auto-generate them while:
      - Preserving original leaf factor order
      - Maintaining 1:1 mapping with bold headings
  
  3. Naming Conventions:
    - Each leaf factor must:
      - Be verbatim from bold heading when possible
      - Be condensed to â‰¤5 words if needed
      - Preserve original risk meaning
  
  4. Validation Rules:
    - Output must be valid JSON only
    - No explanatory text/comments
    - No empty categories
    - All bold headings must be included
    - No factor splitting/merging
  
  5. Special Cases:
    - Single bold heading = single leaf factor
    - Multiple identical headings = keep all instances
    - Non-standard headings = preserve original wording
