  You will receive a list of dictionaries containing risk factor summaries from multiple companies, each with two-level risk factors (root and leaf factors).
  Your task is to merge these risk factors and output the result in the following JSON format while meeting all requirements.

  Output Format:
    {{
    'root factor A': ['leaf factor A1', 'leaf factor A2', ... ],
    'root factor B': ['leaf factor B1', 'leaf factor B2', ... ]
    }}

  Processing Requirements:
  1. Merging Phase:
    - Merge strictly based on leaf factors only, completely ignoring root factors
    - Aggressively merge semantically similar risks (meaning-based, not requiring exact text matches)
    - Keep risk names concise (â‰¤5 English words each)

  2. Categorization Phase:
    - Categorize merged leaf factors into root factors using standard industry classification
    - Use standard categories: Market/Operational/Financial/Compliance/Strategic/Geopolitics/Technology Risks.
  
  3. Quantity Control:
    - Apply aggressive merging - total leaf factors must be <100 (reprocess until compliant)
    - Remove low-frequency factors (appearing <1 times)

  4. Output Requirements:
    - Output only the final JSON result
    - No explanatory text allowed
  
  Optimization Principles:
    - Prioritize retaining high-frequency risks
    - Replace specific descriptions with industry-standard terms
    - Abstract specific cases into general risk types
    - Remove regional/company-specific descriptions
