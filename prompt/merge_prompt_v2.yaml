  You will receive a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a summarized 
  two-level risk factors from a different company.
  Your job is to merge them and return a dictionary following below JSON format and some requirements.
  
  Format:
    {{
    'root factor A': ['leaf factor A1', 'leaf factor A2', ... ],
    'root factor B': ['leaf factor B1', 'leaf factor B2', ... ]
    }}
  
  Requirements:
  - Merge risks with similar meanings. Merge more aggressively. Similar meanings are fine, exact wording isn't necessary.
  - Group risks under the same domain.
  - Create new root/leaf factors if needed.
  - Keep risk names concise (<5 words).
  - Output ONLY the JSON.
