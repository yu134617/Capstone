We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.

Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">30%</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#32;of U.S. net sales in </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2019</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets, including China. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and, as a result, future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">8</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;" href="#sBEA61008012753DEB9365B5DC0024B22"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Disruptions in our merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We rely extensively on information technology to process transactions, compile results, and manage our business. Failure or disruption of our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business. A failure to adequately update our existing systems and implement new systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Given the very high volume of transactions we process it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical systems. Our systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors or misfeasance by our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations. Any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We are currently making and will continue to make investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities. Failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace could be harmful. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process should mitigate this risk. Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">9</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;" href="#sBEA61008012753DEB9365B5DC0024B22"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">difficult for us to realize benefits. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. The potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control in the future, this could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of September 2, 2018, a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support the Company&#8217;s financial reporting processes. During 2019, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weakness and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">September 1, 2019</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">. Completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">If we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information, we could damage our reputation with members and employees, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our members and employees and entrust that information to third-party business associates, including cloud service-providers that perform activities for us. Our warehouse and online businesses depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or defects within our hardware or software, or those of our business associates, that results in our members' or employees' information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation, government actions, or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a breach could require expending significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated in all of our operating countries.</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of non-compliance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to our information technology network. These measures may be undermined, however, due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or external malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">10</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;" href="#sBEA61008012753DEB9365B5DC0024B22"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We are subject to payment-related risks.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, select credit and debit cards, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (&#8220;PCI DSS&#8221;), which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">'</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">s products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">'</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#32;expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long term.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">11</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;" href="#sBEA61008012753DEB9365B5DC0024B22"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers&#8217; compensation, general liability, property damage, directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as any losses to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Market and Other External Risks</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, and other </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">12</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;" href="#sBEA61008012753DEB9365B5DC0024B22"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions leading to loss of sales and profits.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">During </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2019</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, our international operations, including Canada, generated </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">27%</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#32;and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">35%</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#32;of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">13</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;" href="#sBEA61008012753DEB9365B5DC0024B22"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. U.S. and foreign government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. Climate change and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which could face increased regulation. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Legal and Regulatory Risks</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">At the end of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2019</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, we operated </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">239</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#32;warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as the U.K.'s vote to withdraw from the European Union, commonly known as "Brexit", and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">14</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;" href="#sBEA61008012753DEB9365B5DC0024B22"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities and income taxes, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management.

Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters.
