If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our businesses are rapidly evolving, intensely competitive, and subject to changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users. They can use their experiences and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in hiring talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Our competitors may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In addition, new products and services, including those that incorporate or utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning, can raise new or exacerbate existing ethical, technological, legal, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services and adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Our operating results may also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, and content providers; are not appropriately timed with market opportunities; or are not effectively brought to market. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may be able to offer our users and/or customers experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, customers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers or a loss of partners could harm our advertising business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We generated over </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">85%</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#32;of total revenues from advertising in </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2018</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content partners can terminate their contracts with us at any time. Those partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. For example, changes to our data privacy practices, as well as changes to third-party advertising policies or practices may affect the type of ads and/or manner of advertising that we are able to provide which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we do not provide superior value or deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively, our reputation could be affected, we could see a decrease in revenue from advertisers and/or experience other adverse effects to our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative effect on user activity and the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and advertising business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in public policies governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We and other companies in the technology industry have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny recently.

Further, our expansion into a variety of new fields also raises a number of new regulatory issues. These factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations in material ways.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our current operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The creation of Alphabet as a holding company in 2015 and the investments that we are making across various areas in Google and Other Bets are a reflection of our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users. Our investments in Google and Other Bets span a wide range of industries. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from our advertising and related business, use of alternative investment, governance or compensation structures, the fact that such offerings or strategies may not be commercially viable for an indefinite amount of time or at all, or may not result in adequate return of capital on our investments; and unidentified issues may not be discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">The Internet is accessed through a variety of platforms and form factors that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices and modalities, our business could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The number of people who access the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television set-top devices, is increasing dramatically. The functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices and modalities may make the use of our products and services or the generation of advertising revenue through such devices more difficult (or just different), and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compatible or compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media or other platforms, which could affect our search and</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">&#32;</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">advertising business over time. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, we may fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers continue to exist in a dynamic, multi-platform environment.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our revenue growth rate could decline and/or vary over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition and the continued expansion of our business into a variety of new fields. Within our advertising business, changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our revenue growth rate. We may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels or if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, among other factors.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business into a variety of new fields, including through products and services such as Google Cloud, Google Play, and hardware products where margins have generally been lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business, including within advertising where changes such as device mix and property mix can affect margin.

Our security measures may in the future be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers, their products, or otherwise. Such breach or other unauthorized access, increased government surveillance, or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users&#8217; or customers&#8217; data could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, become more sophisticated, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or detect these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.

Authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, including measures to ensure that encryption of users&#8217; data does not hinder law enforcement agencies&#8217; access to that data. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These legislative and regulatory proposals, if adopted, and such interpretations could, in addition to the possibility of fines, result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), became effective in the European Union (EU) beginning on May 25, 2018, and applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users or customers, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU. The GDPR subjects us to a range of new compliance obligations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment which involves substantial costs, and it is possible that despite our efforts, governmental authorities or third parties will assert that our business practices fail to comply. We have been and may in the future be, subject to lawsuits alleging violations of the GDPR. If our operations are found to be in violation of the GDPR&#8217;s requirements, we may be required to change our business practices and/or be subject to significant civil penalties, business disruption, and reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, serious breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide revenues or &#8364;20 million. Fines of up to the higher of 2% of annual worldwide</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">&#32;</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">revenues or &#8364;10 million can be levied for other specified violations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In addition, the European Commission in July 2016 and the Swiss Government in January 2017 approved the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, respectively, which are designed to allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with the Privacy Shield requirements to freely import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. This has resulted in some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Many companies, in particular those in internet, technology and media own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained by bringing claims against us, whether such claims are meritorious or not. As we have grown, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:center;text-indent:0px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">12</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:center;text-indent:0px;font-size:9pt;"><div style="padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:99.609375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;"><tr><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td style="width:50%;"></td><td style="width:50%;"></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;" href="#s3A72DA4193545F4B849FF498BB9C1EAA"></a></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="text-align:right;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#656565;font-weight:bold;">Alphabet Inc.</font></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and/or indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims brought against us. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, including our product and service offerings, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand as well as affect our ability to compete.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word &#8220;Google&#8221; could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word &#8220;search.&#8221; Some courts have ruled that "Google" is a protectable trademark, however it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the United States, may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word &#8220;Google&#8221; to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. Effecting these strategic transactions could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.

Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be false or misleading.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Furthermore, if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in our brands, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

We may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively affect our operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition, a significant hardware supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We may enter into long term contracts that commit us to significant terms and conditions of supply. We may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because many of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The products and services we sell or offer may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet our users&#8217; and/or customers&#8217; expectations or our products or services are found to be defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and, where applicable, our company policies, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. If any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could affect the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Web spam, including content farms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Web spam refers to websites that violate or attempt to violate our guidelines or that otherwise seek to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Web spam may also affect the quality of content posted on our platforms and may manipulate them to display false, misleading or undesirable content. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Although English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately. We continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly.

These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results.

In particular, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries, and they, along with Sundar Pichai, the Chief Executive Officer of Google, play an important role in the development of our technology. They also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, particularly in light of our holding company structure, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively affect our future success.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures, including legal actions, that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by Internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in the United States the Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules effective June 11, 2018, which could lead internet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users, customers and advertisers, goodwill, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users, customers and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">New and existing technologies could affect our ability to customize ads and/or could block ads online, which would harm our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Technologies have been developed to make customizable ads more difficult or to block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the core functionality of third-party digital advertising. Most of our Google revenues are derived from fees paid to us in connection with the display of ads online.

As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related assertions, examples include transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">The trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile.

As of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">December 31, 2018</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, $1.7 billion remains available for repurchase. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $12.5 billion of our Class C capital stock. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares.

As of December 31, 2018, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric E. Schmidt beneficially owned approximately 92.8% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which represented approximately 56.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of Larry, Sergey and Eric&#8217;s current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial.
