As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, service providers, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases. These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online, and they include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d&#233;cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental.

Furthermore, customers are increasingly shopping online and seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including leveraging the momentum of our strategic investments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience. Failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery and pickup options could negatively impact our profit margins and the demand for our products.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could adversely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior interconnected customer experience or through maintenance of effective sales and marketing, advertising or promotional programs leveraging both our digital and physical platforms, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, we are operating in a highly inflationary environment. If inflation increases beyond our ability to control our related costs, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand, or it may adversely affect our ability to compete based on price. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; shifts in consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, public health issues (including pandemics and related impacts), natural disasters, or changes in the macroeconomic environment that impact our customers, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data, however, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security and customer expectations around data collection and use. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. Customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also changing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers routinely and increasingly use technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product reviews, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products, and new channels and tools to expand the customer experience appear and change rapidly. Our Pros also look for additional capabilities, including a dedicated sales team, competitive credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their planned purchase needs. Once products are purchased, customers seek alternate options for delivery of those products, including advance ordering through digital platforms for Pros, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery and/or convenient pickup options. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the shopping and purchasing process by continuing to adjust and enhance the online and in-store customer experience as well as our delivery options. The coordinated operation of our network of physical stores, distribution facilities, and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy. We cannot guarantee that our current or future fulfillment options will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery or pickup times, options and costs. In addition, as our customers continue to leverage our enhanced interconnected shopping and fulfillment options, a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-selling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance. A greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment could also result in higher costs for delivery, potentially impacting our profit margins.</span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><span style="color:#fc671a;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K</span></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">11</span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"><div style="text-align:right"><img src="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/354950/000035495023000059/hd-20230129_g1.jpg" alt="hd-20230129_g1.jpg" style="height:25px;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:25px"/></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Table</a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7"> of </a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Contents</a></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Failure to provide a relevant or effective online customer experience in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment; or to otherwise timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">A positive brand and reputation are critical to our business success, and, if our brand and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, current and potential associates, suppliers, vendors, and shareholders, and, consequently, our business and results of operations or the price of our stock.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our brand and reputation are critical to attracting customers, current and potential associates, suppliers and vendors to do business with us. We must continue to manage and protect our brand and reputation. Negative incidents can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our brand and reputation; undermine our customers&#8217; confidence in us; reduce demand for our products and services; affect our ability to recruit, engage, motivate and retain associates; attract regulatory scrutiny; and impact our relationships with current and potential suppliers and vendors. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, governance, political, public policy, economic, geopolitical, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups. Customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company, including our products and services, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. Negative sentiment about the Company shared over social media, or misinformation from fraudulent accounts impersonating the Company, could impact our brand and reputation, whether or not it is based in fact. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The execution of initiatives to expand our supply chain and enhance the interconnected shopping experience could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We continue to invest in our interconnected retail strategy, including by making significant investments to expand our supply chain. These investments are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers; simplify customer interactions; provide our customers with a more interconnected shopping experience; better address Pro planned purchase needs; and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. Executing our interconnected retail strategy requires continual investment in our operations and information technology systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes, systems and support. Building out our supply chain also involves significant real estate projects as we expand our distribution network, requiring us to identify and secure available locations with appropriate characteristics needed to support the different types of facilities. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new online tools and services, implementing new technologies, implementing and restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact our profitability. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, our stores are a key element of our interconnected retail strategy, serving as the hub of our customers&#8217; interconnected shopping experience. We have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. We also need to identify and secure available locations with appropriate characteristics for new stores to ensure we can continue to serve our customers effectively. Our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect or fully support an interconnected shopping experience. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as protect against loss or theft of our inventory (also called &#8220;shrink&#8221;), including as a result of organized retail crime. High rates of shrink, which we continue to experience, or an unsafe store environment, requires operational changes that may increase costs and adversely impact the customer and associate experience. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our investments to enhance our interconnected shopping experience and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or </span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><span style="color:#fc671a;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K</span></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">12</span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"><div style="text-align:right"><img src="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/354950/000035495023000059/hd-20230129_g1.jpg" alt="hd-20230129_g1.jpg" style="height:25px;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:25px"/></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Table</a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7"> of </a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Contents</a></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with certain suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with certain suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with certain suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers and generally carry higher margins than national brand products. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships, maintain favorable terms with current suppliers, or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies. We generally expect that these transactions will result in sales increases, cost savings, synergies, enhanced capabilities or various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our acquisitions, we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the target company&#8217;s products, services, associates, and information technology, financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, technology and cybersecurity systems, and operations and may make them more difficult to manage. Even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional risks and liabilities. Strategic transactions may also be subject to significant regulatory uncertainty. The changing enforcement landscape may result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated outcome of a transaction. Any failure in the execution of a strategic transaction or investment, our approach to the integration of an acquired asset or business, or achievement of synergies or other benefits could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:9pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">OPERATIONAL RISKS</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates and maintain a productive relationship with those associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including increased market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, employment, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics and expectations among the workforce; public health concerns; and our reputation within the labor market. We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions often have high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. We have faced and may continue to face additional challenges in recruiting and retaining associates due to wage pressure; flexible scheduling needs; disruption in the availability of childcare; challenges related to a remote or hybrid working environment for associates who work in our store support centers; and health and safety concerns. We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our associates from time to time and, if successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility and efficiency, and/or otherwise negatively impact our operations or reputation. These factors, together with growing competition among potential employers, have resulted in and may continue to result in increased salaries, benefits, or other employee-related </span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><span style="color:#fc671a;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K</span></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">13</span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"><div style="text-align:right"><img src="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/354950/000035495023000059/hd-20230129_g1.jpg" alt="hd-20230129_g1.jpg" style="height:25px;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:25px"/></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Table</a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7"> of </a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Contents</a></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">costs, and/or may impair our ability to recruit and retain associates, which could have an adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">In addition, to execute our interconnected retail strategy, including our supply chain investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals, to implement our ongoing technology and other investments.

Some of these systems are managed or provided by third-party service providers, including certain cloud platform providers. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of, and consistent access to, operational and financial data for information such as sales, customer data, supplier data, associate data, job applicant data, partner data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer service, and post-purchase matters. For these information technology systems, applications, and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems, applications or processes could impair, and on occasion have impaired, their effectiveness or could expose us to security risks. Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to and on occasion have experienced damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power and other critical infrastructure outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; data or security breaches; internal or external data theft or misuse; cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, smishing, vishing, spyware, denial of service attacks, and ransomware; responsive containment measures by us that may involve voluntarily taking systems offline; natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other extreme weather events; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines; military conflicts, acts of war, terrorism or civil unrest; other systems outages; inadequate or ineffective redundancy; and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. In addition, as more business activities have shifted online, and as many of our store support associates continue to work in a remote or hybrid environment, we face an increased risk due to the potential failure of internal or external information technology infrastructure as well as increased cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts are not always successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security; impact our ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems; be costly, time-consuming and resource-intensive to remedy; and adversely impact our reputation and relationship with our customers, suppliers, shareholders or regulators.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other third-party service providers. These investments involve replacing existing systems, some of which are older, legacy systems that are less flexible and efficient, with successor systems; outsourcing certain technology and business processes to third-party service providers; making changes to existing systems, including the migration of applications to the cloud; maintaining or enhancing legacy systems that are not currently being replaced; or designing or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, failures in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. Any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, security failures, reputational harm, and increased costs that could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.</span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><span style="color:#fc671a;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K</span></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">14</span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"><div style="text-align:right"><img src="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/354950/000035495023000059/hd-20230129_g1.jpg" alt="hd-20230129_g1.jpg" style="height:25px;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:25px"/></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Table</a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7"> of </a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Contents</a></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Through our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms. We use our digital platforms as sales channels for our products and services, as methods of providing inspiration, and as sources of product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to help drive sales. We also have multiple online communities, digital platforms, and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. The retail industry is continually evolving and expanding, with a significant increase in sales initiated online and via mobile applications. We may not be successful at managing this increased volume and related delivery options without interruption in the future. Additionally, we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to a digital and interconnected experience. We continually seek to enhance all of our online and digital properties to provide a personalized, user-friendly interface for our customers. Disruptions, delays, failures or other performance issues with our customer-facing technology systems, either due to increased volume, system modifications, or other factors, or a failure of these systems to meet our or our customers&#8217; expectations, could impair the value they provide, adversely impact our sales, and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the availability and distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, such as the industry-wide supply chain challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our ability to receive and deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair our ability to meet customer demand for products, and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, and/or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution or fulfillment centers or those of our supply chain service providers; weather-related events; cybersecurity incidents or attacks; natural disasters; international trade disputes, trade policy changes or restrictions, or import- or export-related governmental sanctions or restrictions; customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; quotas, tariffs or other import-related taxes; strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shortages of supply chain labor, including truck drivers; shipping capacity constraints, including shortages of related equipment; raw material or other shortages; third-party contract disputes or inability to maintain favorable contract terms; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; increased costs or unavailability of fuel; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; acts of terrorism; public health issues, including pandemics or quarantines (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others; civil unrest; or other factors beyond our control. In recent years, ports in the U.S. and elsewhere have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters.

We also work with third-party service providers that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the handling of information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are vulnerable to continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and will continue to attempt to gain access, to these systems and data through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates or third-party service providers. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain exploitable vulnerabilities, bugs, or defects in design, maintenance or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. We have experienced and continue to face the ongoing risk of exploitation of our software providers and our software development and implementation process, including from coding and process vulnerabilities and the installation of so-called back doors that provide unauthorized access to systems and data. The increased use of a remote workforce has also expanded the possible attack surface areas. In addition, the risk of cyber-attacks has increased in connection with Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting geopolitical conflict.

The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving, increasing in frequency and sophistication, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. </span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To protect against unauthorized access to or use of data, prevent data loss, preserve data integrity, and protect our own access to systems, we have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and procedures; third-party assessments and testing; and annual associate training and other specific training initiatives. However, the ever-evolving threats mean that we and our third-party service providers and business partners must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of companies we acquire. There is no guarantee that the measures we take will be adequate to safeguard against all threats, including vulnerabilities, data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. As we saw in connection with the data breach we experienced in 2014, any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, job applicant, business partner, or Company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of anomalous activity or compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, as occurred in the case of the data breach we experienced in 2014, we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the occurrence of a security incident.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business. Our business depends on our customers&#8217;, associates&#8217;, job applicants&#8217; and business partners&#8217; willingness to entrust us with their personal information. Events that adversely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our customers, associates, job applicants, or business partners of our uses of their information or failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers&#8217;, associates&#8217;, job applicants&#8217; and business partners&#8217; personal information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction (including human error or malfeasance) or that of our service providers or other third parties, could adversely affect our brand and harm our reputation. Further, the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business. The implementation of these requirements has also become more complex. Maintaining our compliance with evolving requirements, including state privacy laws, requires significant effort and cost, requires changes to our business practices, and may limit our ability to collect and use certain data to support the customer experience. In addition, failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits or reputational damage. Additionally, our cyber insurance coverage may not be adequate for liabilities or costs actually incurred, and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage of a future claim.</span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards, cash, checks, PayPal, installment loan programs, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult, costly, or uncertain. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment.

The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers&#8217; products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers.

A number of merchandise categories have been impacted by higher inflation than that which we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, and the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. If inflation increases costs beyond our ability to control our related costs, we may not be able to adjust prices or use our portfolio strategy to sufficiently offset the effect without negatively impacting consumer demand or our gross margin. Further, our MRO customers, who have higher spend and longer-term relationships than a typical retail customer, primarily use trade credit to finance their purchases, and some of our Pros use trade credit in order to purchase our products. As a result, their ability to pay is highly dependent on the economic strength of the industry in their areas.

In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies, and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations has become increasingly complex. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data privacy and cybersecurity; the sale, marketing, sourcing, and pricing of some of our products; transportation, logistics and interstate delivery operations, including Department of Transportation regulations on vehicles and drivers; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes, including changes to corporate tax rates; restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; competition and antitrust requirements; ESG programs, transparency and reporting; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our sales, operations or profitability. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations.

Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; international trade disputes, trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; limitations on access to ports; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; compliance with forced labor laws; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. For example, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. As a portion of our retail products are sourced, directly or indirectly, outside of the U.S., major changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and profitability of retail product sales in our U.S. locations. Other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations. In addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability.</span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><span style="color:#fc671a;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K</span></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">19</span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"><div style="text-align:right"><img src="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/354950/000035495023000059/hd-20230129_g1.jpg" alt="hd-20230129_g1.jpg" style="height:25px;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:25px"/></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Table</a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7"> of </a><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#i34ff7b01e284464c95e860d997837e7d_7">Contents</a></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and periodic delays in delivery.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took several steps to support our associates, including expanding certain compensation and benefits to help alleviate some of the challenges our associates were facing as a result of COVID-19, and adopted a number of enhanced safety measures in our stores and other facilities. We have transitioned from these temporary pay and benefits programs, as well as many of the enhanced safety measures. However, due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and the consequences of our actions, we may see unexpected outcomes from rolling back safety measures as conditions evolve, particularly if there are further outbreaks. If we do not respond appropriately to any further COVID-19 outbreaks, if our customers or associates do not participate in safety measures, or if rolling back safety measures results in additional outbreaks, the well-being of our associates and customers could be at risk. Furthermore, any failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response, could cause reputational harm to our brand and/or subject us to claims and litigation from associates, customers, suppliers, regulators or other third parties. Additionally, we have faced, and may continue to face, periodic labor shortages at our stores due to COVID-19 and other illnesses like influenza that were less prevalent during the height of the pandemic, which can result in modifications to our operations and negatively impact our business, costs and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Additionally, some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers&#8217; compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures.

These issues, which may continue or expand depending on the progression of the pandemic, have placed strain on the domestic and international supply chain, which has affected and may continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition. Similarly, increased demand for online purchases of products impacted our fulfillment operations, as well as those of our third-party carriers, resulting in delays in delivering products to customers. The operation of our distribution and fulfillment centers is crucial to our business operations. We and our suppliers have experienced, and may continue to experience, labor shortages at some of our distribution and fulfillment centers, and any such labor shortages, whether temporary or sustained, may adversely impact the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers.
