Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie&#8217;s employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie&#8217;s employees, patients, customers and business partners. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie&#8217;s operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to-date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower </span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:3.011%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.527%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:27.828%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">15 </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%"> </span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:middle"><div><img src="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1551152/000155115221000008/abbv-20201231_g2.gif" alt="abbv-20201231_g2.gif" style="height:13px;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:70px"/><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%"> </span><span style="color:#444867;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:14pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">|</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">&#160;</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">2020 Form 10-K</span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div style="text-align:right"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio.

In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, "Business&#8212;Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity" and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations," and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, "Legal Proceedings." The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $19.8 billion in 2020, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">inter partes</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property.

Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval.

AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful.

There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics&#8212;including Humira&#8212;could adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVie&#8217;s biologic products, including Humira. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie&#8217;s biologic products, AbbVie&#8217;s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVie&#8217;s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.</span></div><div style="text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available hepatitis C treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie&#8217;s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVie&#8217;s products, and this could negatively impact AbbVie&#8217;s business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.</span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:27.681%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.673%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:3.013%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:middle"><div style="text-align:right"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">2020 Form 10-K </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%"> </span><span style="color:#444867;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:14pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">|</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">&#160;</span><img src="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1551152/000155115221000008/abbv-20201231_g2.gif" alt="abbv-20201231_g2.gif" style="height:13px;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:70px"/></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="text-align:right"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">18</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div style="text-align:right"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers.

If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be taken by such regulatory authorities.

If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated.

AbbVie&#8217;s substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio as a result of the acquisition may exacerbate these risks and have the effect of, among other things, reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and/or lowering its credit ratings. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes.

The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "project" and similar expressions, among others, generally identify "forward looking statements," which speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward looking statements. In particular, information included under Item 1, "Business," Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contain forward looking statements. Where, in any forward looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of AbbVie management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated include the matters described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
