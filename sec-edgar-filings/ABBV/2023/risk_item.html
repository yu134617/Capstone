In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products continue to expand into the biotechnology field and form partnerships to pursue biosimilars. Companies have developed and are developing biosimilars that compete with AbbVie&#8217;s biologic products, including Humira. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie&#8217;s biologic products, AbbVie&#8217;s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration of or successful challenges to AbbVie&#8217;s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face increased litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">For example, Humira accounted for approximately 37% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2022. Humira is facing competition from biosimilar products in the United States beginning in 2023 due to the loss of exclusivity, which AbbVie anticipates will cause a significant decline in Humira's revenue and could adversely affect AbbVie&#8217;s revenues and operating earnings.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, "Business&#8212;Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity" and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations," and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, "Legal Proceedings." </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">A significant portion of AbbVie's revenue and operating earnings are derived from several major products. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie's patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">inter partes</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses may diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product.

In addition, in its pursuit of valid business opportunities, AbbVie may be required to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that it believes were improperly granted. Resolving an intellectual property infringement or other claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products. Such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture or the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for regulatory approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, "Business&#8212;Regulation&#8212;Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing." To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced.

The Inflation Reduction Act is to be implemented through forthcoming agency action, the outcome of which cannot be reasonably determined with certainty. Additionally, changes to U.S. tax laws now require (i) a 15% minimum tax generally applied to U.S. corporations on adjusted financial statement income beginning in 2023 and (ii) a non-deductible 1% excise tax provision on net stock repurchases, to be applied to repurchases beginning in 2023. AbbVie continues to evaluate the impact that the Inflation Reduction Act may have on the company.

Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe.

AbbVie cannot predict with certainty if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers.

Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of AbbVie's commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and current governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. As a result, manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics&#8212;including Humira and Skyrizi &#8212;could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.</span></div><div style="text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that research, develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics.

All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie&#8217;s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. In addition, as AbbVie products lose exclusivity, competition surrounding such products will increase and generic and biosimilar products will increasingly penetrate the markets. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, have lower prices or better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, or have superior performance features than AbbVie&#8217;s products, and this may negatively impact AbbVie&#8217;s business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused AbbVie to modify certain of its business practices, and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie&#8217;s employees, patients, customers and business partners. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie&#8217;s operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to date was not material, AbbVie experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 and other public health outbreaks on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 or any other public health outbreak on AbbVie&#8217;s operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of the disease globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to it and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 or any other public health outbreak may not completely prevent AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;padding-left:22.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:8pt;text-indent:24.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.

The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing.

To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further.

The prevalence of counterfeit/diverted medicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-commerce, which increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, greatly enhancing consumers' ability to obtain prescriptions and other medical treatments via the internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacies. This can expose patients to greater risks as the internet is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit/diverted product offers and scams because of the anonymity it affords.

The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "project" and similar expressions and uses of future or conditional verbs, generally identify "forward looking statements," which speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. In particular, information included under Item 1, "Business," Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contain forward looking statements. Where, in any forward looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed or implied, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of AbbVie management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated include, but are not limited to, the matters described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." AbbVie does not undertake, and specifically declines, any obligation to update the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, unless AbbVie is required by applicable securities law to do so.</span></div><div style="text-indent:24.75pt"><span><br/></span></div><div id="i8aa2d13e9ab74474a8ce0ca02e5f47bc_22"></div><div>
