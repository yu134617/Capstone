Direct sales to WT Microelectronics accounted for </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">17%</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> of our net revenue for </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">fiscal year</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">2019</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">.

We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">20%</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> of our net revenue for fiscal year </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">2019</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> and approximately </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">25%</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> for fiscal year </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">2018</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by our significant customers.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition, our top customers&#8217; purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. We expect this trend to continue, which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and, should we fail to comply with such terms, might also result in substantial liability that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Moreover, the terms and conditions under which we do business with most of our semiconductor customers generally do not include commitments by those customers to purchase any specific quantities of products from us. Even in those instances where we enter into an arrangement under which a customer agrees to source an agreed portion of its product needs from us (provided that we are able to meet specified development, supply and quality commitments), the arrangement often includes pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. If we do not perform under these arrangements, we could also be liable for significant monetary damages. In addition, we are selling an increasing amount of our semiconductor products through a limited number of distributors, which may expose us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes third-party wafer foundry and module assembly and test capabilities, referred to as contract manufacturers. Our semiconductor products require semiconductor wafer manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques, and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We depend on our contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. Although we often have long-term contracts with our contract manufacturers, we do not generally have long-term capacity commitments. We obtain substantially all of our manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and our contract manufacturers have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product. Further, from time to time, our contract manufacturers will cease to, or will become unable to, manufacture a component for us. As the lead time needed to identify, qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields, with a new contract manufacturer is typically lengthy, there is often no readily available alternative source for the wafers or other contract manufacturing services we require, and there may be other constraints on our ability to change contract manufacturers. In addition, qualifying such contract manufacturers is often expensive, and they may not produce products as cost-effectively as our current suppliers, which would reduce our margins. In any such circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">13</span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;" href="#sD2CB18B59EEA52948E1A0D6DE63583DF"></a></div></div><div><br/></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We utilize TSMC to produce the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafers. TSMC manufactured approximately </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">85%</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> of the wafers manufactured by our contract manufacturers during </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">fiscal year</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">2019</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">. Our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of TSMC. However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including certain of our competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice, or raise their prices to us, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and gross margin.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Any substantial disruption in TSMC&#8217;s supply of wafers to us, or in the other contract manufacturing services that we utilize, as a result of a natural disaster, political unrest, military conflict, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We also depend on our contract manufacturers to timely develop new, advanced manufacturing processes, including, in the case of wafer fabrication, transitions to smaller geometry process technologies. If these new processes are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them, we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or to deliver products to our customers, which could result in loss of revenue opportunities and damage our relationships with our customers.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers rely on many materials, including silicon, gallium arsenide and indium phosphide wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. We purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor materials, components and finished goods used in our products from a few materials providers, some of which are single source suppliers. During the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">fiscal year</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">2019</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">, we purchased more than </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">two-thirds</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> of the materials for our manufacturing processes from </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">five</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> materials providers. Substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis, and we do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials providers. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases, capacity constraints or other factors, which may lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. In the event that we cannot timely obtain sufficient quantities of materials or at reasonable prices, the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">A general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry, an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity. Adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected our business and results of operations. In recent periods, investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook have adversely affected market and business conditions in general. Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt. An escalation of recent trade tensions between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets or compete effectively with Chinese companies. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, especially China, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. Such events may also (i) cause our customers and consumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology spending, (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers, and (iv) intensify pricing pressures. Any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">A majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue.

If any conditions or changes to the structure of an acquisition are required to obtain these regulatory approvals, they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of such acquisition or reducing our anticipated benefits of the transaction. If we agree to any material conditions in order to obtain any such approvals or if we fail to comply with any such conditions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">These difficulties may be complicated by factors such as the size of the business or entity acquired, geographic and cultural differences, lack of experience operating in the industry or geographic markets of the acquired business, potential loss of key employees and customers, the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business, performance problems with the acquired business&#8217; technology, failure to realize the benefits of transition services arrangements, exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business, insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition, adverse tax consequences and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospects or synergies expected from any such acquisition.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">If we fail to complete an announced acquisition, our stock price could fall to the extent the price reflects an assumption that such acquisition will be completed, and we may incur significant unrecoverable costs. Further, the failure to consummate an acquisition may result in negative publicity and adversely impact our relationships with our customers, vendors and employees. We may become subject to legal proceedings relating to the acquisition and the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses, achieve anticipated levels of profitability of the acquired business, improve margins of the acquired businesses and products, or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition could materially harm our business, operating results and margins.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">From time to time, we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business, either acquired or otherwise, or we may exit minority investments, each of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. Any future dispositions we may make could involve risks and uncertainties, including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any such dispositions could result in disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions. For example, in connection with such dispositions, we often enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships, including long-term research and development arrangements and sales arrangements, or agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser, which may result in additional expenses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, dispositions may include the transfer of technology and/or the licensing of certain IP rights to third-party purchasers, which could limit our ability to utilize such IP rights or assert these rights against such third-party purchasers or other third parties.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense.

These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current U.S. administration, especially in light of recent trade tensions with China. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. For example, on May 15, 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., one of our customers, to its &#8220;Entity List&#8221; and placed certain export restrictions on Huawei and its suppliers, which required us to suspend certain sales to Huawei during the pendency of such restrictions and which has had a corresponding adverse effect on our revenue.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition, the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur. For example, if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared, it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards, lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution. In addition, it is expected that the current U.S. administration&#8217;s trade policy will promote U.S. manufacturing and </span></div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">16</span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;" href="#sD2CB18B59EEA52948E1A0D6DE63583DF"></a></div></div><div><br/></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">manufacturers.

Tan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. None of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts. In addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management.

We also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel (including cybersecurity experts), as well as effective sales professionals, through acquisitions we may make from time to time or otherwise. We have historically encountered some difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers, particularly in Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia where qualified engineers are in high demand. In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers, further limiting the pool of available talent. Further, our employees, including employees whom we have retained as a result of an acquisition, may decide not to continue working for us and may leave with little or no notice. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset. We have granted multi-year equity awards to most of our employees. These awards approximate four consecutive annual grants that vest in four tranches with successive four-year vesting periods. While we believe these awards provide a powerful long-term retention incentive to employees, we may be incorrect in this assumption, particularly if there is a material and persistent decline in the price of our stock. In addition, we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future equity compensation plans. As a result, we may be limited in granting equity-based incentives and may impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary </span></div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">17</span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;" href="#sD2CB18B59EEA52948E1A0D6DE63583DF"></a></div></div><div><br/></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">personnel.

Some of these actions may seek injunctive relief, including injunctions or exclusion orders against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages, which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigations by the FTC and the European Commission into certain of our contracting practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Litigation or settlement of such actions, regardless of their merit, or involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be complex, can extend for a protracted period of time, can divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, and is frequently costly, with the related expenditures unpredictable. An unfavorable resolution of a governmental investigation may include, among others, fines or other orders to disgorge profits or make other payments, and/or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting practices, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including actions by patent-holding companies that do not make or sell products.

However, our contract manufacturers and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such third-party claims. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. We do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings, given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in IP litigation.

In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.</span></div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">19</span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;" href="#sD2CB18B59EEA52948E1A0D6DE63583DF"></a></div></div><div><br/></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers&#8217; commitments, our customers&#8217; ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers&#8217; forecasts and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for our customers&#8217; products, as well as seasonal or cyclical trends in their industries or the semiconductor industry.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">To ensure the availability of our semiconductor products, particularly for our largest customers, we typically start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers&#8217; forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or that may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;padding-left:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used) and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general, and in our business in particular. Periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as &#8220;design wins&#8221;. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any. A delay or cancellation of a customer&#8217;s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins occurring at the same time, may strain our resources and those of our contract manufacturers. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional, unanticipated costs and expenses. Often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units from us until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources and we may not always be able to satisfy customers&#8217; qualification requirements. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;padding-left:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery </span></div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">20</span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;" href="#sD2CB18B59EEA52948E1A0D6DE63583DF"></a></div></div><div><br/></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">methods.

Some of our direct competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors. We expect this consolidation trend to continue, which may result in the combined competitors having greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development or marketing resources than us. In addition, some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base or more comprehensive IP portfolio and patent protection than us. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We compete with integrated device manufacturers and fabless semiconductor companies, as well as the internal resources of large, integrated OEMs. Because our products are often building block semiconductors, providing functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits (&#8220;ICs&#8221;), we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, as well as customers that may develop their own IC products. Our competitors in these markets range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products and devices to smaller companies specializing in niche markets and new technologies.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our competitors also include large vendors of hardware and operating system software and cloud service providers. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of customers in any particular market, larger technical staffs, more established relationships with hardware vendors, or greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from numerous start-ups and smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who may provide software and intellectual property for free, competitors who may offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who may develop competing products.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their IP or other proprietary information, including interface or interoperability information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities or other significant operations, or those of our suppliers, could have a material adverse</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes, in order to protect our IP, to accelerate time to market of our products and to ensure supply of certain components. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the film bulk acoustic resonator components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers and suppliers, are located in California and the Pacific Rim region, which has above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. In addition, our research and development personnel are primarily concentrated in China, Czech Republic, India, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Colorado, California and Pennsylvania, with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">A prolonged disruption at one or more of our manufacturing facilities for any reason, especially our Colorado, Singapore and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our contract manufacturers or suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness at one or more of these facilities, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. Any such event would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers resulting in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.</span></div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">21</span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;" href="#sD2CB18B59EEA52948E1A0D6DE63583DF"></a></div></div><div><br/></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We must maintain appropriate capacity at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand for our proprietary products. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks, such as delays in completion. Such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Any failure of our IT systems or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors to provide</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">necessary services could have a material adverse effect on our business.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We depend on various IT systems, including networks, applications, internal IT systems and personnel, and outsourced services for, among other things, financial reporting and product orders and shipments. We rely on third-party vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services on a timely and effective basis and to adequately address cybersecurity threats to their own systems. Services provided by these third parties include certain services related to shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network development and network monitoring. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, we may be unable to collect on any award of damages and any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs we may incur as a result of a vendor&#8217;s failure to perform under its agreement with us. Upon expiration or termination of any of our third-party vendor agreements we may not be able to timely replace the vendor on terms and conditions, including service levels and costs, which are favorable to us. In addition, a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations by harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand, manage our supply chain and production facilities, fulfill customer orders, and report financial and other information on a timely and accurate basis.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product mix, price erosion, acquisitions we may make, level of capacity utilization and commodity prices.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets. A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products, as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and non-product revenue, could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages. In addition, increased competition and the existence of product alternatives, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors, and other factors may lead to further price erosion, lower revenue and lower margin for us in the future.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our gross margin may also be adversely affected by expenses related to the acquisitions of businesses, such as amortization of intangible assets and restructuring and impairment charges. Furthermore, businesses or companies that we acquire may have different gross margin profiles than us and could, therefore, also affect our overall gross margin.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment, leading to high fixed costs, including depreciation expense. If we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities, such as depreciation expense, will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin. Furthermore, fluctuations in commodity prices, either directly in the price of the raw materials we buy, or as a result of price increases passed on to us by our suppliers, could negatively impact our margins. We do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices, some of which (including gold and fuel prices) are very volatile, and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We utilize a significant amount of IP in our business.

If we lose access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software. In addition, if software providers and hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest vendors, adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access, this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products.

Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely affect our sales, revenue and reputation. Additionally, our government contracts are generally subject to certain requirements, some of which are generally not present in commercial contracts and/or may be complex, as well as to audits and investigations. Failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties, and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future, which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties, some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive.

Further, although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements, it is common for such software to be available &#8220;as-is&#8221; with no warranty, indemnity or support. Although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions, such use, under certain circumstances, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;padding-left:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">From time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may in the future lead to significant expense. Our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions, relating to product quality issues. The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some cases, including in agreements with some of our largest customers, are potentially unlimited. Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. For example, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices. In such an event, we may incur significant costs and expenses, including among others, replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims. Conversely, in some cases, amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs, which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely affect our operating costs.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Highly complex products, such as those we offer, may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions, software documentation or enhancements are released, or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development.

Furthermore, if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production of or deployed a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs. Significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases. As a result, if there is system-wide failure, it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier&#8217;s product. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. To resolve these problems, we may have to invest significant capital and other resources. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others. For example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer&#8217;s end-product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security, or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer&#8217;s systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our solutions could be harmed. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts, and we would likely lose, or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products. As a result, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We make substantial investments in research and development to enhance existing and develop new technologies to keep pace with technological advances and to remain competitive in our business, and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles and evolving industry standards, new delivery methods and require substantial investment in our research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. In addition, semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries. This requires us to adapt our products and manufacturing processes to these new technologies, which requires expertise in new procedures. Our failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. We expect the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future, due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop. If we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products may be reduced. Significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased investments in research and development could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We collect, use and store (collectively, &#8220;process&#8221;) a high volume, variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business, particularly in relation to our Symantec Business.

A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of participants in the semiconductor industry are also joining voluntary social responsibility initiatives such as the U.N. Global Compact, a voluntary initiative for businesses to develop, implement and disclose sustainability policies and practices. These social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to comply, with such policies or provisions, a customer may stop purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition, as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products.

Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expense to remediate any internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on our stock price.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive, time consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, as we grow our business or acquire other businesses, our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls, either in our existing business or in businesses that we acquire, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or The Nasdaq Global Select Market.</span></div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">27</span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;" href="#sD2CB18B59EEA52948E1A0D6DE63583DF"></a></div></div><div><br/></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:6px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially concerning revenue recognition, may negatively impact our financial results.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying those standards in our accounting policies.

For example, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;Topic 606&#8221;) became effective for us starting with fiscal year 2019. In connection with the CA Merger and our changes to CA&#8217;s business strategy, including our adoption of a policy that allows customers to terminate their CA software contracts for convenience, we have been required to establish revenue recognition accounting policies and procedures under Topic 606 that we believe are appropriate for the business as we intend to conduct it.

As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. For example, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;2017 Tax Reform Act&#8221;) adopted broad U.S. corporate income tax reform, which among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate, but imposed base-erosion prevention measures on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. entities as well as the transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated non-U.S. earnings of U.S. controlled foreign corporations. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:24px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#8217;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings.

For example, our principal tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, an agency of the Government of Singapore, provides that any qualifying income we earn in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Absent these tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate that would otherwise apply to our Singapore taxable income would be 17%. These Singapore tax incentives are expected to expire in November 2025, subject to potential extensions, which we may or may not be able to obtain, and any subsequent changes in incentive scope or legislative developments.

Depending on the incentive at issue, we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep the incentive, which may not be as beneficial to us as the present structure or tax strategy.
