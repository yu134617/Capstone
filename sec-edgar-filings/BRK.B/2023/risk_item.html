We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties.

In 2018, Berkshire&#8217;s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire&#8217;s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire&#8217;s insurance operations.

The failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretation of existing regulations relating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.</span></p> <p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:center;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">K-</span><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">26</span></p> <hr style="page-break-after:always;" /> <p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:0.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:left;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">&#160;</span></p> <p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">Risks unique to our regulated businesses</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;"> </span></p> <p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;"> </span></p> <p style="text-indent:4.667%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate in excess of $15 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Various provisions of our policies, negotiated to limit our risk, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend, as it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period.</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;"> </span></p> <p style="text-indent:4.667%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. It is possible that significant claims may emerge or develop in the future from the policies we have written in the past. As industry practices and legal, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge, including new or expanded theories of liability. These or other changes could impose new financial obligations on us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($143 billion at December 31, 2022), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings.</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;"> </span></p> <p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital.</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;"> </span></p> <p style="text-indent:4.667%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital.</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;"> </span></p> <p style="text-indent:4.667%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF&#8217;s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business.

To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF&#8217;s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;"> </span></p> <p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:center;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">K-</span><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">27</span></p> <hr style="page-break-after:always;" /> <p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:0.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:left;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">&#160;</span></p> <p style="text-indent:4.667%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management&#8217;s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; managing and reporting transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;"> </span></p> <p style="text-indent:4.667%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;, serif;min-width:fit-content;">Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers&#8217; needs and reliability criteria. System assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The operational or financial failure of capital projects may not be recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses.</span></p> <p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:6.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;" id="item_1b_unresolved_staff_comments">
