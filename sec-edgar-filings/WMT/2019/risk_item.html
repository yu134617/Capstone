Other segments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our increasing eCommerce investments may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping digitally.

As a result, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected, which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations.

Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.

We may also face reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and may also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. The applicability to us of laws related to such sales is currently unsettled and we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.

Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our eCommerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer "Walmart Pickup," "Pickup Today," "Club Pickup" and "Online Grocery" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth or eCommerce acquisitions) and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single "hackers" or small groups of "hackers." Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">18</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Any breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments.

Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Financial Risks</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock. </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">20</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">During fiscal 2019, our Walmart International operations generated approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">24%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also sources goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions on eCommerce offerings in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws and fluctuations in currency exchange rates resulting from the UK's pending exit from the European Union. We expect continued uncertainty around the extent of the impact of this exit on our business until the UK and the European Union put in alternative trade and other arrangements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In fiscal 2019, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">21</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations and there are aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear as additional guidance from the U.S. tax authority is pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation.

The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the "DEA"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">For example, in the United States the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the United States. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation.

One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. Shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception among certain audiences of our role as a corporate citizen. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and with respect to investigations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">While we have made an Accrual for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future) will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future.</font></div><div><a name="s755A1B36A95C5781B194DC45855CAB6A"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><div style="padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;width:95.32163742690058%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;"><tr><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td style="width:11%;"></td><td style="width:89%;"></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="text-align:left;font-size:10pt;">
