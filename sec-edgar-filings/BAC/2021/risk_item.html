These negative economic conditions may have a continued adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations, which could include: decreased demand for and use of our products and services; protracted periods of historically low interest rates; lower fees, including asset management fees; lower sales and trading revenue due to decreased market liquidity resulting from heightened volatility; higher levels of uncollectible reversed charges in our merchant services business; increased noninterest expense, including operational losses; and increased credit losses due to our customers' and clients' inability to fulfill contractual obligations and deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, which may vary by region, sector or industry, that may increase our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs. Our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs may also continue to be impacted by volatility in the energy and commodity markets. Additionally, our liquidity and/or regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by customers&#8217; withdrawal of deposits, volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, volatility in foreign exchange rates and customer draws on lines of credit. Continued adverse macroeconomic conditions could also result in potential downgrades to our credit ratings, negative impacts to regulatory capital and liquidity and further restrictions on dividends and/or common stock repurchases. </span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If we become unable to operate our businesses from remote locations including, for example, because of an internal or external failure of our information technology infrastructure, we experience increased rates of employee illness or unavailability, or governmental restrictions are placed on our employees or operations, this could adversely affect our business continuity status and result in disruption to our businesses.

Additionally, global markets, including energy and commodity markets, may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.

The continued protracted period of lower interest rates has resulted in lower revenue through lower net interest income, which has adversely affected our results of operations. Additional periods of lower interest rates or a move to negative interest rates in the U.S., could have a further adverse impact on our net interest income and results of operations.

For example, additional fiscal stimulus and rising debt levels, in the U.S. and abroad, in response to the ongoing pandemic could affect macroeconomic conditions, market liquidity conditions, and interest rates. Significant fiscal policy changes and/or initiatives, including as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration and Congress, may also increase uncertainty surrounding the formulation and direction of U.S. monetary policy and volatility of interest rates. Higher U.S. interest rates relative to other major economies could increase the likelihood of a more volatile and appreciating U.S. dollar. Changes, or proposed changes, to certain U.S. trade and international investment policies, particularly with important trading partners (including China and the EU) have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation, including through the use of tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury Bonds.

If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. Changes to fiscal policy, including rapid expansion of U.S. federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance, could also affect market interest rates.

In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa. These types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets.

We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets, illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets, the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements (including as a result of credit concerns for short-term borrowing), changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile, prolonged federal government shutdowns, or changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources. Additionally, our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort, unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit, slower customer payment rates, restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients, the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds (which could result from customer attrition for higher yields, the desire for more conservative alternatives or our customers&#8217; increased need for cash), increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries, changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or default by a significant market participant or third party (including clearing agents, custodians or central counterparties (CCPs)).

Credit spreads are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of a similar maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in mark-to-market or credit valuation adjustment exposures. Changes in our credit spreads are market-driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile. We may also experience spread compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits due to increased marketplace rate competition. Additionally, concentrations within our funding profile, such as maturities, currencies or counterparties, can reduce our funding efficiency.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Reduction in our credit ratings could significantly limit our access to funding or the capital markets, increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies, which consider a number of factors, including our financial strength, performance, prospects and operations and factors not under our control, such as the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including the macroeconomic stress caused by the pandemic. </span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time, and there can be no assurance as to when and whether downgrades will occur. A reduction in certain of our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, or bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries, were downgraded by one or more levels, we may suffer the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing, and/or incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements.

In 2013, the FDIC issued a notice describing its preferred &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy for resolving a G-SIB. Under this approach, the FDIC could replace Bank of America Corporation with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors.

FHLMC and Fannie Mae (FNMA) are currently in conservatorship with their primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) acting as conservator. In September 2019, the Treasury Department published a proposal to recapitalize FHLMC and FNMA and remove them from conservatorship as well as reduce their role in the marketplace. Consistent with this proposal, in January 2021, the Treasury Department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of FHLMC and FNMA to allow them to retain their earnings until they reach certain previously determined capital requirements, among other policy actions, potentially putting them on a long-term path to emergence from conservatorship. However, we cannot predict the future prospects of the GSEs, timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship, or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs in the housing market.

In particular, LIBOR is used in many of our products and contracts, including derivatives, consumer and commercial loans, mortgages, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate products and financial instruments. The aggregate notional amount of these products and contracts is material to our business, and there are significant risks and challenges associated with the transition that may result in significant uncertainty, or have other consequences that cannot be fully anticipated, which expose us to various financial, operational, supervisory, conduct and legal risks. </span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Although certain ARRs have been proposed to replace LIBOR and other IBORs, market and client adoption of ARRs may vary across or within categories of contracts, products and services, resulting in market fragmentation, decreased trading volumes and liquidity, increased complexity and modeling and </span></div></div><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:2.586%;min-width:1.586%;vertical-align:top"></div><div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;width:48.708%"><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">operational risks. ARRs have compositions and characteristics that differ significantly from the benchmarks they may replace, in some cases have limited history, and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace. Additionally, most ARRs are calculated on a compounded or weighted-average basis, involve complex billing and reconciliation and, unlike IBORs, do not reflect bank credit risk and therefore may require a spread adjustment. The market transition from IBORs to ARRs is complex and there are important differences between the fallbacks, triggers and calculation methodologies being implemented in cash and derivatives markets (including within cash markets). Any mismatch between the adoption of ARRs in loans, securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented, and as a result we may experience unanticipated market exposures. There can be no assurance that ARRs will be comparable or adequate alternatives to IBORs or perform in the same way, that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to IBORs will transition successfully to ARRs, of the timing of adoption and degree of integration and acceptance of ARRs in the financial markets, or of the future availability or representativeness of such ARRs. </span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">The discontinuation of IBORs, including LIBOR, requires us to transition a significant number of IBOR-based products and contracts, including related hedging arrangements (IBOR Products). Although, a significant majority of the aggregate notional amount of our LIBOR-based products and contracts maturing after 2021 include or have been updated to include fallbacks to ARRs, the transitioning of certain contracts, products and clients will be more complex. While some of these outstanding IBOR Products include fallback provisions to ARRs, some of these products and contracts do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms and require remediation to modify their terms. Additionally, some outstanding IBOR Products are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification. Legislation has been adopted in the EU and proposed in the U.S. and the U.K. to address such challenges in IBOR Products, including the use of a statutory replacement or &#8220;synthetic&#8221; rate to replace the existing benchmark rate in certain of our IBOR Products. Litigation, disputes or other action may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of legislation, in particular, if there is an overlap between legislation introduced in different jurisdictions. There is no guarantee that the legislative proposals will become law and no assurance that we and other market participants will be able to successfully modify all outstanding IBOR Products or be adequately prepared for a discontinuation of an IBOR at the time such IBOR may cease to be published or otherwise discontinued. Also, there can be no assurance that existing or new provisions for successor rates in our IBOR Products will include adequate methodologies for adjustments or that the characteristics of the successor rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks they seek to replace. These changes may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into, the value of such loans, securities or derivative instruments, the trading market for such products and contracts, and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk. Certain impacted clients, counterparties and other market participants may refuse, delay, or lack operational readiness to transition to ARRs, resulting in the risk that some contracts and products may not transition to an ARR before discontinuation of the relevant IBOR, exposing us to financial, operational, supervisory, conduct and legal risks.</span></div></div></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">19</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%"> Bank of America</span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="width:100.000%"><div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;width:48.706%"><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our products and contracts that reference IBORs, in particular LIBOR, may contain language that determines when a successor rate including the ARR and/or the applicable spread adjustment to the designated rate (including IBORs) would be selected or determined.

This can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services, either from a decrease in the volume of transactions or through a compression of spreads.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, the widespread adoption and rapid evolution of new technologies, including analytic capabilities, self-service digital trading platforms, internet services, distributed ledgers, such as the blockchain system, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our online and mobile banking channel strategies in </span></div></div></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="text-align:right"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Bank of America </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%"> </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">20</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="width:100.000%"><div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;width:48.706%"><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">addition to remote connectivity solutions.

Model risk management is a dedicated and independent risk function that defines model risk governance, policy and guidelines for the Corporation based on laws, rules and regulations, as well as internal requirements. Under the Corporation's Enterprise Model Risk Policy, model risk management is required to perform model oversight, including independent validation before initial use, ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking, and periodic revalidation. Models are subject to inherent limitations due to the use of historical trends and simplifying assumptions, uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes, and emerging risks from the use of applications that rely on AI.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our models and strategies may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior and liquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events, which could limit their effectiveness.

Such disasters could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers&#8217; ability to pay outstanding loans, damage collateral or result in the deterioration of the value of collateral or insurance shortfalls. Additionally, climate change concerns could result in transition risk. Changes in consumer preferences and additional legislation and regulatory requirements, including those associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy, could increase expenses or otherwise adversely impact the Corporation, its businesses or its customers. We could also experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation and technology and market changes, and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to our response to climate change and our climate change strategy. </span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success, business prospects and competitive position.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals.
