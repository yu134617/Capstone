Risk Factors</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Additional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Forward-looking Statements</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">22</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Managing Risk</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">42</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#e31837;font-weight:bold;">Market</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#ff0033;font-weight:bold;"> </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the U.S. and international financial markets, U.S. and non-U.S. fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic conditions generally.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">General economic, political and social conditions in the U.S. and in one or more countries abroad affect markets in the U.S. and abroad and our business. In particular, markets in the U.S. or abroad may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, unexpected changes in gross domestic product (GDP), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, consumer spending, employment levels, wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, bankruptcies, a default by a significant market participant, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the global financial markets, the growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure and investor sentiment and confidence. Additionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenue and adversely </span></div></div></div><div><br/></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;"><div style="padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:99.609375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;"><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:34%;"></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="text-align:left;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Demi,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">5</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">&#160;</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;">Bank of America</span></div><div style="text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:4px;text-align:left;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><br/></div><div style='display:inline-block; width:100%;'><div style='float:left; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the U.S. and abroad, uncertainties surrounding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management, and other central banks are beyond our control and difficult to predict and can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities, and impact our borrowers. A continued protracted period of lower interest rates, or a move to negative interest rates in the U.S., could result in lower revenue, and maintain or increase pressure on net-interest income, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Uncertainty or ongoing developments in connection with the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU, and the resulting impact on the financial markets and regulations in relevant jurisdictions, could negatively impact our revenues and ongoing operations in Europe and beyond.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies, including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy and healthcare, may adversely impact U.S. or global economic activity and our customers', counterparties' and the Corporation's earnings and operations. For example, significant fiscal policy initiatives may increase uncertainty surrounding the formulation and direction of U.S. monetary policy and volatility of interest rates. Higher U.S. interest rates relative to other major economies could increase the likelihood of a more volatile and appreciating U.S. dollar. Changes, or proposed changes, to certain U.S. trade policies, particularly with important trading partners, including China and the EU, have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation, including through the use of tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury Bonds. Further, the use of tariffs among countries not directly involving the U.S. could spread and could damage our customers directly and indirectly.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Any of these developments could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses, our customers, our securities and derivatives portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels, liquidity and our results of operations. Additionally, events and ongoing uncertainty related to the U.K.'s exit from the EU and the uncertainty related to the transition from Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs) could negatively impact markets in the U.S. and abroad and our business and/or magnify any negative impact of the above referenced developments on our business, customers and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Increased market volatility and adverse changes in other financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our liquidity, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates, fluctuations in equity and futures prices, lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products, the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect, among other things, (i) the value of our on- and off-balance sheet securities, trading assets and other financial instruments, (ii) the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, (iii) the value of assets under management (AUM), (iv) fee income relating to AUM, (v) customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, (vi) the volume of client activity in our trading operations, (vii) investment banking fees, (viii) the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and (ix) our competitiveness with respect to </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">deposit pricing. For example, the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. In addition, the low interest rate environment and a flat or inverted yield curve could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations, including future revenue and earnings growth.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations. For more information regarding models and strategies, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">17</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa. These types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. In addition, challenging market conditions may also adversely affect our investment banking fees.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information about market risk and our market risk management policies and procedures, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Market Risk Management</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">71</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">We may incur losses if the value of certain assets declines, including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including certain loans and loan commitments, loans held-for-sale, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale (AFS) debt and marketable equity securities, other debt securities, equity method investments and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments. We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations, including higher or lower mortgage banking income and earnings, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. Increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations. In addition, increases in interest rates may adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and, thus, capital levels.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. </span></div></div></div><div><br/></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;"><div style="padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;"><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td style="width:34%;"></td><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:33%;"></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:top;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="text-align:right;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;">Bank of America </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:7pt;">&#160;</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Demi,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">6</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><br/></div><div style='display:inline-block; width:100%;'><div style='float:left; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. Asset values also directly impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses. We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients&#8217; portfolios or investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive performance fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of our clients&#8217; portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information on fair value measurements, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">to the Consolidated Financial Statements</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.

We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets, illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets, the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements, including as a result of credit concerns for short-term borrowing, changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile, prolonged federal government shutdowns, or changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources. Additionally, the unwillingness or inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort, unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit, restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients, the withdrawal of customer deposits, which could result from customer attrition for higher yields or the desire for more conservative alternatives, increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries, changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event, failure by a significant market participant or third party, such as a clearing agent or custodian, reputational issues, or negative perceptions about our short- or long-term business prospects, including downgrades of our credit ratings may adversely affect our liquidity. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control, such as general market volatility, disruption, shock or stress, Federal Reserve policy decisions, including fluctuations in interest rates or Federal Reserve balance sheet composition, negative views about the Corporation or financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event, changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies, actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. The impact of these events, whether within our </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">control or not, could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments, unforeseen outflows of cash, the need to draw on liquidity facilities, the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding, debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests and the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies, as well as unexpected collateral calls, among other things, the result of which could be a liquidity shortfall and/or impact on our liquidity coverage ratio.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market conditions, including changes in interest and currency exchange rates, and to our credit spreads. Credit spreads are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of a similar maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in mark-to-market or credit valuation adjustment exposures. Changes in our credit spreads are market-driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile. We may also experience spread compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits due to increased marketplace rate competition. Additionally, concentrations within our funding profile, such as maturities, currencies or counterparties, can reduce our funding efficiency.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information about our liquidity position and other liquidity matters, including credit ratings and outlooks and the policies and procedures we use to manage our liquidity risks, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Liquidity Risk</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">50</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Adverse changes to our credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies could significantly limit our access to funding or the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies, which consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as the current economic and geopolitical environment, and to a lesser extent, the likelihood of the U.S. government providing meaningful support to us or our subsidiaries in a crisis.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time, and there can be no assurance as to when and whether downgrades will occur. A reduction in certain of our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, or bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries, were downgraded by one or more levels, we may suffer the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing, and/or incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements. Under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, if our or our subsidiaries&#8217; credit ratings are downgraded, the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements.</span></div></div></div><div><br/></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;"><div style="padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:99.609375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;"><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:34%;"></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="text-align:left;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Demi,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">7</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">&#160;</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;">Bank of America</span></div><div style="text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:4px;text-align:left;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><br/></div><div style='display:inline-block;

We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal, regulatory, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company, which could result in adverse liquidity events. The parent company depends on dividends, distributions, loans, advances and other payments from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Any inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Additional restrictions on related party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.

In the current plan, Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s preferred resolution strategy is a &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy. This strategy provides that only the parent holding company files for resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and contemplates providing certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company. Bank of America Corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries. Pursuant to these arrangements, if Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent, Bank of America Corporation will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries, and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and meet our payment obligations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:16px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">If the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly determine that Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s resolution plan is not credible, they could impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. Further, we could be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and could potentially result in the divestiture or restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:16px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Additionally, under the Financial Reform Act, when a G-SIB such as Bank of America Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution. In the event of such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. In 2013, the FDIC issued a notice describing its preferred &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy for resolving a G-SIB. Under this approach, the FDIC could replace Bank of America Corporation with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors. The FDIC&#8217;s &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:16px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information about resolution planning, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Item 1.

A deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Global and U.S. economic conditions and macroeconomic or market events and disruptions, including a continuing slowdown in global GDP growth, a decline in consumer spending, a decline in property values or an asset price correction, increasing consumer and corporate leverage, as well as rising unemployment, fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates, widespread health emergencies or pandemics and/or natural disasters, may impact our credit portfolios. In addition, significant economic or market stresses and disruptions could have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets, increasing the risk that borrowers or counterparties would default or become delinquent in their obligations to us, which could lead to recessionary conditions and/or increase our credit losses and provision for credit losses, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In particular, increases in delinquencies and default rates could adversely affect our consumer credit card, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased charge-offs and provision for credit losses. A deteriorating economic environment in the U.S. or globally could also adversely affect our consumer and commercial loan portfolios with weakened client and collateral positions. Simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit and/or an increase in a borrower&#8217;s leverage in a weakening economic environment could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio, should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations. The impact of this could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers, elevated asset prices and/or declining property or collateral values unrelated to macroeconomic stress.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We estimate and establish an allowance for credit losses for losses inherent in our lending activities (including unfunded lending commitments), excluding those measured at fair value, through a charge to earnings. The process for determining the amount of the allowance requires us to make difficult and complex judgments, including forecasting how borrowers will react to changing economic conditions. The ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations will likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. There is also the possibility that we will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or that we will fail to accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers and the reserves that we hold.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We may suffer unexpected losses if the models and assumptions we use to establish reserves and make judgments in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties prove inaccurate in predicting future events. In addition, external factors, such as the macroeconomic or market events disclosed above can also negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. As of January 1, 2020, we implemented a new accounting standard to estimate our allowance for credit losses.

In such an event, we may increase the size of our allowance which would reduce our earnings.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the ordinary course of our business, we also may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic, financial or business developments. For example, concentrations in credit risk may result in a particular industry, geographic location, product, asset class, counterparty, individual exposure or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry, geographic location, product or asset class, or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">While our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurers, mutual funds and hedge funds, central counterparties and other institutional clients. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry. Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses and defaults. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of default of a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us, which may occur as a result of fraud or other events that impact the value of the collateral. Further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the ordinary course of business, we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities. Unfavorable economic or political conditions, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, changes in oil prices, social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit risk.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We also have concentrations of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate, auto, consumer credit card and commercial real estate portfolios, which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio. Additionally, decreases in home price valuations or commercial real estate valuations in certain markets where we have large concentrations, including as a result of climate change or natural disasters (e.g., rising sea levels, hurricanes and fires), as well as more broadly within the U.S. or globally, could result in increased defaults, delinquencies or credit loss.

We remain conscious of geographic markets where housing price growth has slowed or decreased and other geographic markets where housing prices have declined, as further declines in future periods may negatively impact the demand for many of our products. Additionally, our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market, both of which may be adversely affected by rising interest rates. Conditions in the U.S. housing market during the most recent financial crisis resulted in both significant write-downs of asset values in several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed securities, and exposure to monolines. If the U.S. housing market were to weaken, the value of real estate could decline, which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses and negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa, may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. Certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change in the credit rating of a particular Bank of America entity or entities, we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other remedial actions and could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks. In some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We are also a member of various central counterparties (CCPs) in part due to regulatory requirements for mandatory clearing of derivative transactions, which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to CCPs. In the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults on its obligations, we may be required to pay a portion </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. A CCP may modify, in its discretion, the margin we are required to post, which could mean unexpected and increased exposure to the CCP. As a clearing member, we are exposed to the risk of non-performance by our clients for which we clear transactions, which may not be covered by available collateral. Additionally, any default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information on our derivatives exposure, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">to the Consolidated Financial Statements</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#e31837;font-weight:bold;">Geopolitical</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">We are subject to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We do business throughout the world including in emerging markets. Economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally, resulting in, among other things, market volatility, reduced market value and economic output. Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, financial, social or judicial instability, changes in government leadership, including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, high inflation, natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, capital controls, currency redenomination risk, exchange controls, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation. Additionally, protectionist trade policies and continued trade tensions between the U.S. and important trading partners, particularly China and the EU, including the risk that tariffs continue to rise and other restrictive actions are taken that weigh heavily on regional trade volumes and domestic demand through falling business sentiment and lower consumer confidence, could adversely affect our businesses and revenues. These risks are especially elevated in emerging markets. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">A number of non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we do business have been or may be negatively impacted by slowing growth or recessionary conditions, market volatility and/or political unrest. In Europe, the political and economic environment remains challenging due to slowing GDP growth, debt concerns of certain EU countries and elevated recessionary risks, including in Germany and the U.K. The current degree of European political and economic uncertainty could increase and create additional market volatility and negatively impact our business and results of operations. Significant market volatility and geopolitical unrest could also result from ongoing uncertainty related to the U.K.'s exit from the EU and the transition period during which the terms of such exit will be negotiated, which could adversely affect us. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Potential risks of default on or devaluation of sovereign debt in some non-U.S. jurisdictions could expose us to substantial losses. Risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations, including our U.S. operations. Market and economic disruptions of all types may affect consumer confidence levels and spending, corporate investment and job creation, bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt, economic growth rates and asset values, among other factors. Any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Corporation. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including emerging markets.

In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our potential inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses and changes to our organizational structure and have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations in that market, as well as our reputation in general.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In addition to non-U.S. legislation, our international operations are also subject to U.S. legal requirements. For example, our operations are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, and economic sanctions, which can vary by jurisdiction. The increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heightens financial crimes risk. Our ability to comply with these legal requirements depends on our ability to continually improve detection and reporting and analytic capabilities.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the U.S., debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, which have increased the possibility of U.S. government defaults on its debt and/or downgrades to its credit ratings, and prolonged government shutdowns could negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition, including our liquidity. Additionally, changes in fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations, organizational structure and results of operations. We are also subject to geopolitical risks, including acts or threats of terrorism, actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response thereto, state-sponsored cyber attacks or campaigns and/or military conflicts, which could adversely affect business and economic conditions abroad, as well as in the U.S.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Non-U.S. Portfolio</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">66</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">The U.K. Referendum, and the planned exit of the U.K. from the EU, could adversely affect us.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our subsidiaries in the U.K. France and Ireland.

Upon exit, a transition period began during which time the U.K. and the EU expect to negotiate a trade agreement and other terms associated with their future relationship. The transition period is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020. The ultimate impact and terms of such negotiation and any trade or other agreements remain unclear, and short- and long-term global economic and market volatility and disruptions to regional and global financial markets may occur, including as a result of currency fluctuations and trade relations. There can be no guarantee that the U.K. and EU will reach an agreement on trade or any other matters during the transition period or that the transition period will be extended if agreements are not reached.

If uncertainty resulting from the U.K.&#8217;s exit or the end to the transition period negatively impacts economic conditions, financial markets, including currency markets and consumer confidence, or clients, counterparties, and financial markets are not prepared for the trade and other agreements that are ultimately agreed upon or the transition period ends without a trade or other agreements, our business, results of operations, financial position and/or operational model could be adversely affected. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We are also subject to different laws, regulations and regulatory authorities and may incur additional costs and/or experience negative tax consequences as a result of establishing our principal EU banking and broker-dealer operations outside of the U.K., which could adversely impact our EU business, results of operations and operational model.

We continuously update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations globally. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions.

Our business relies on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, personal and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We, our employees and customers, regulators and other third parties are regularly the target of cyber attacks and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks. These cyber attacks are pervasive and evolving and include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code (such as ransomware), phishing attacks, denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction or theft of confidential, proprietary and other information, including intellectual property, of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties, damages to systems, or otherwise material disruption to our or our customers&#8217; or other third parties&#8217; network access or business </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">operations, both domestically and internationally. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures, investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents and develop our capabilities to respond and recover. Cyber threats are rapidly changing, and despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate cyber attacks or information or security breaches, nor may we be able to implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address such attacks or breaches. Even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise. Internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature and pervasiveness of cyber threats, our prominent size and scale, our role in the financial services industry and the broader economy. The financial services industry is particularly at risk because of the proliferation of new and emerging technologies, including third-party financial data aggregators, and the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, our plans to continue our use of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics, increase our internet and mobile banking products, including mobile payment and other web- and cloud-based products and applications, and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Additionally, our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, including our vendors and regulators, our geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, threats of cyber terrorism, external extremist parties, including state-sponsored actors, in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends, and system and customer account updates and conversions result in heightened risk exposure. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, intellectual property and proprietary information, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a critical priority. Cybersecurity risks have also significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increasingly sophisticated activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. The techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently, and these attacks or ensuing security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected. It could take considerable additional time for us to determine the scope, extent, amount, and type of information compromised, at which time the impact on the Corporation and measures to recover and restore to a business as usual state may be difficult to assess. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties, including their downstream service providers and the financial services industry, with whom we do business, upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely.

As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities or third-party or their downstream service providers could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any technology failure, cyber attack or other information or security breach, termination or constraint of any third party, including their downstream service providers, the financial services industry infrastructure or financial data aggregators, could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to conduct day-to-day business activities, effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses, result in the misappropriation or destruction of the personal, proprietary or confidential information of our employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties or result in fraudulent or unauthorized transactions.

Cyber attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in significant lost revenue, give rise to losses or have other negative consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business.

This could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws in the U.S. and abroad, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered ineffective.

Further, we could become subject to future regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated, including rulemaking related to the Financial Reform Act and the U.K.'s exit from the EU. The cumulative effect of all of the legislation and regulations on our business, operations and profitability remains uncertain. This uncertainty necessitates that in our business planning we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of the proposed rules. If these assumptions prove incorrect, we could be subject to increased regulatory and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm. In addition, U.S. and international regulatory initiatives may overlap, and non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed U.S. regulations, which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our regulators&#8217; prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions, and they have assumed an active oversight, inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry.

Additionally, the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of our operations and the aggressiveness of the regulatory environment worldwide also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Additionally, actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities. Responding to inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and proceedings, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the attention of our senior management from our business. The outcome of such proceedings, which may last a number of years, may be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We are currently subject to the terms of settlements, orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities and may become subject to additional settlements, orders or agreements in the future. Such settlements, orders or agreements can impose significant operational and compliance costs on us as they typically require us to enhance our procedures and controls, expand our risk and control functions within our lines of business, invest in technology and hire significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel. Moreover, if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements, orders or agreements to which we are subject, or, more generally, fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities, we could be required to enter into further settlements, orders or agreements and pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to identify, assess, monitor and report on applicable laws, policies and procedures, compliance risks will continue to exist, particularly as we adapt to new and evolving laws, rules and regulations. Additionally, changing U.S. fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies arising from potential changes to the U.S. presidential administration and Congress result in ongoing regulatory uncertainties. There is no guarantee that our risk management and compliance programs will be consistently executed to successfully manage compliance risk. We also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk. Future legislative or regulatory actions, and any required changes to our business or operations, or those of third parties, including their downstream providers, upon whom we rely, resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue, impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability, limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, require us to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. In addition, legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time that may result in fines, regulatory sanctions, penalties, equitable relief and changes to our business practices.

Greater than expected litigation and investigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, including liquidity, and results of operations, and/or cause significant reputational harm to us. We continue to experience a significant volume of litigation and other disputes, including claims for contractual indemnification with counterparties regarding relative rights and responsibilities. Consumers, clients and other counterparties continue to be litigious. Among other things, financial institutions, including us, continue to be the subject of claims alleging anti-competitive conduct with respect to various products and markets, including U.S. antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages. In addition, regulatory authorities have had a supervisory focus on enforcement, including in connection with alleged violations of law and customer harm. For example, U.S. regulators and government agencies have pursued claims against financial institutions under </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#222222;">the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act,</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> False Claims Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act and antitrust laws. Such claims may carry significant and, in certain cases, treble damages.

Our G-SIB surcharge may increase from current estimates, and we are also subject to a countercyclical capital buffer which, while currently set at zero, may be increased by regulators. In 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal to implement a stress capital buffer into its capital requirements, which may increase our regulatory capital requirements, if adopted. A significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our risk-weighted assets and our leverage exposure, which may increase. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets, including a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk and constraints on the use of internal models, as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches. U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Additionally, Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements have been proposed, which would apply to us and our subsidiary depository institutions, and target longer term liquidity risk. While the impact of these proposals remains uncertain, they could have a negative impact on our capital and liquidity positions. In 2019, U.S. banking regulators published a final rule outlining a standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which updates the calculation of the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the regulatory capital rule. The final rule will be effective on April 1, 2020, with a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2022.

Additionally, the changing regulatory environment may create competitive disadvantages for us given geography-driven capital and liquidity requirements. For example, U.S. regulators have in certain instances adopted stricter capital and liquidity requirements than those applicable to non-U.S. institutions. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In addition, emerging technologies and advances and the growth of e-commerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions, made it easier for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and allowed non-traditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services, including electronic securities trading, marketplace lending, financial data aggregation and payment processing, including real-time payment </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">platforms. Further, clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky, such as cryptocurrencies. Increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices or credit standards on our products and services requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology and/or reducing our market share, or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our business.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad range of financial products and services, delivered through multiple distribution channels. Our success depends on our, and our third-party vendors', ability to adapt and develop products, services and technology to rapidly evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. There is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services on more attractive terms, including higher interest rates on deposits, and offer lower cost investment strategies, which may impact our ability to grow revenue and/or effectively compete. Additionally, legislative and regulatory developments may affect the competitive landscape. Further, the competitive landscape may be impacted by the growth of non-depository institutions that offer traditional banking products at higher rates or with no fees, or otherwise offer alternative products. This can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services, either from a decrease in the volume of transactions or through a compression of spreads. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In addition, the widespread adoption and rapid evolution of new technologies, including analytic capabilities, self-service digital trading platforms, internet services, distributed ledgers, such as the blockchain system, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our online and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions. We may not be as timely or successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers. Our or our third-party vendors' inability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could hurt our business prospects and competitive position.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals.

The models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators, which may not be representative of the next downturn and would magnify the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. Our models may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee them and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes, they contain erroneous data, assumptions, valuations, formulas or algorithms or our applications running the models do not perform as expected. Regardless of the steps we take to ensure effective controls, governance, monitoring and testing, and implement new technology and automated processes, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if models and strategies fail to properly anticipate and manage current and evolving risks.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Failure to properly manage and aggregate data may result in our inability to manage risk and business needs, errors in our day-to-day operations, critical reporting and strategic decision-making and inaccurate financial, regulatory and operational reporting.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We rely on our ability to manage, aggregate, interpret and use data in an accurate, timely and complete manner for effective risk reporting and management.

The continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021, and there is substantial risk that LIBOR will be modified by 2021 or discontinued thereafter. This announcement, in conjunction with financial benchmark reforms and changes in short-term interbank lending markets more generally, have resulted in significant uncertainty about the potential or actual discontinuation of IBORs, including LIBOR, and certain other rates or indices that serve as &#8220;benchmarks.&#8221; Such benchmarks are used extensively in the global financial markets and in our business. In particular, LIBOR is used in many of our products and contracts, including mortgages, consumer, commercial and corporate loans, derivatives, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate products and financial instruments. The aggregate notional amount of these products and contracts is material to our business. These reforms and actions may result in significant uncertainty as to future rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks, cause new or reformed benchmarks to perform differently from the discontinued benchmarks they are replacing, cause existing benchmarks to disappear or become unavailable or unrepresentative, or have other consequences that cannot be fully anticipated, which expose us to various financial, operational and legal risks. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:1px;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#231f20;">Certain ARRs have been proposed to replace LIBOR and other IBORs. For example, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants and official-sector entities convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, the market transition from IBORs to ARRs is complex and pervasive throughout a number of different types of products and global financial markets. There can be no assurance that ARRs will be adequate alternatives to IBORs, that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to IBORs will transition successfully to ARRs, of the timing of adoption and degree of integration and acceptance of such ARRs in the global financial markets, or of the future availability or representativeness of such ARRs. Our products and contracts that reference IBORs, in particular LIBOR, may contain language that determines when a successor rate including the ARR and/or the applicable spread adjustment to the designated rate (including IBORs) would be selected or determined. If a trigger is satisfied, our products and contracts may give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate to be selected. The considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuation of IBORs and/or such IBORs ceasing to be acceptable reference rates in financial instruments could ultimately result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based products and contracts. Accordingly, uncertainty regarding ARRs may continue to impact our business, operations and financial condition repeatedly and indefinitely. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:1px;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">The discontinuation of IBORs, including LIBOR, will require us to remediate IBOR-based products and contracts, including related hedging arrangements, that mature after the discontinuation date of the IBOR.

Also, there can be no assurance that existing or new provisions for successor rates in our IBOR-based products and contracts will include adequate methodologies for adjustments between the applicable IBOR and the corresponding successor rate or that the characteristics of the successor rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks they seek to replace.
