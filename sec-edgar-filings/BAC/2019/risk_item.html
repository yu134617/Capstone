<span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#e31837;font-weight:bold;">Item 1A. Risk Factors </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Additional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Forward-looking Statements</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">20</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Managing Risk</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">40</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#e31837;font-weight:bold;">Market</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#ff0033;font-weight:bold;"> </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the U.S. and international financial markets, U.S. and non-U.S. fiscal and monetary policies and economic conditions generally.</span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Financial markets and general economic, political and social conditions in the U.S. and in one or more countries abroad, including the level and volatility of interest rates, unexpected changes in market financing conditions, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, consumer spending, employment levels, wage stagnation, prolonged federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, bankruptcies, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the global financial markets, the growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, terrorism, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure, investor sentiment and confidence, the sustainability of economic growth and any potential slowdown in economic activity may affect markets in the U.S. and abroad and our businesses. Any market downturn in the U.S. or abroad would likely result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the U.S. and abroad, uncertainties surrounding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including potential further increases in its target funds rate and the ongoing reduction in its balance sheet, and other central banks are beyond our control and difficult to predict and can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and impact our borrowers, potentially increasing delinquency and default rates as interest rates rise. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy and healthcare may adversely impact us. For example, significant fiscal policy initiatives may increase uncertainty surrounding the formulation and direction of U.S. monetary policy, and volatility of interest rates. Higher U.S. interest rates relative to other major economies could increase the likelihood of a more volatile and appreciating U.S. dollar. Changes, or proposed changes to certain U.S. trade policies, particularly with important trading partners, including China, could upset financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation through the use of tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury Bonds.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Any of these developments could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses, our securities and derivatives portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels and liquidity and the costs of running our business, and our results of operations. Additionally, events and ongoing uncertainty related to the planned exit of the U.K. from the EU could magnify any negative impact of these developments on our business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Increased market volatility and adverse changes in other financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our liquidity, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates, fluctuations in equity and futures prices, lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products, the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect, among other things, (i) the value of our on- and off-balance sheet securities, trading assets, other financial instruments and MSRs, (ii) the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, (iii) the value of assets under management (AUM), (iv) fee income relating to AUM, (v) customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, (vi) </span></div></div></div><div><br/></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;"><div style="padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:99.609375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;"><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:34%;"></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="text-align:left;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Demi,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">5</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">&#160;</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;">Bank of America 2018</span></div><div style="text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:4px;text-align:left;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><br/></div><div style='display:inline-block; width:100%;'><div style='float:left; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">the volume of client activity in our trading operations, (vii) investment banking fees, (viii) the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and (ix) our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing. For example, the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. In addition, the low but rising interest rate environment and recent flattening of the yield curve could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, including future revenue and earnings growth.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations. For more information regarding models and strategies, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">16</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa. These types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. In addition, challenging market conditions may also adversely affect our investment banking fees.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information about market risk and our market risk management policies and procedures, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Market Risk Management</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">70</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">We may incur losses if the value of certain assets declines, including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including certain loans and loan commitments, loans held-for-sale, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale (AFS) debt and marketable equity securities, other debt securities, equity method investments, certain MSRs and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments. We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations, including higher or lower mortgage banking income and earnings, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. For example, decreases in interest rates and increases in mortgage prepayment speeds, which are influenced by interest rates and other factors such as reductions in mortgage insurance premiums and origination costs, could adversely impact the value of our MSR asset, and cause a significant acceleration of purchase premium amortization on our mortgage portfolio, because a decline in long-term interest rates shortens the expected lives of the securities, and adversely affects our net </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">interest margin. Conversely, increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations. In addition, increases in interest rates may adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and, thus, capital levels.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. Asset values also directly impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses. We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients&#8217; portfolios or investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive performance fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of our clients&#8217; portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information on fair value measurements, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Note 20 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">to the Consolidated Financial Statements</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.

We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets; illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets; the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements due to credit concerns for short-term borrowing; changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile; prolonged federal government shutdowns; changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources; the refusal or inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort; simultaneous draws on lines of credit; the withdrawal of customer deposits, which could result from customer attrition for higher yields or the desire for more conservative alternatives; increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries; failure by a significant market participant or third party, such as a clearing agent or custodian; reputational issues; or negative perceptions about our short- or long-term business prospects, including downgrades of our credit ratings.

The impact of these events, whether within our control or not, could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments, unforeseen outflows of cash, the need to draw on liquidity facilities, debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests, the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies, as well as unexpected collateral calls, among other things, the result of which could be a liquidity shortfall and/or impact on our liquidity coverage ratio.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market interest rates and to our credit spreads. Credit spreads are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of a similar maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in mark-to-market or credit valuation adjustment exposures. Changes in our credit spreads are market-driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile. Additionally, concentrations within our funding profile, such as maturities, currencies or counterparties, can reduce our funding efficiency.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information about our liquidity position and other liquidity matters, including credit ratings and outlooks and the policies and procedures we use to manage our liquidity risks, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Liquidity Risk</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> in the MD&#38;A on page </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">47</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Adverse changes to our credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies could significantly limit our access to funding or the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies, which consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as the likelihood of the U.S. government providing meaningful support to us or our subsidiaries in a crisis.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time, and there can be no assurance as to when and whether downgrades will occur. A reduction in certain of our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical.

We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal, regulatory, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company, which could result in adverse liquidity events. The parent company depends on dividends, distributions, loans, advances and other payments from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Additional restrictions on related party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Also, regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors.

In the current plan, Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s preferred resolution strategy is a &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy. This strategy provides that only the parent holding company files for resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and contemplates providing certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company. Bank of America Corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries. Pursuant to these arrangements, if Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent, Bank of America Corporation will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries, and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and meet our payment obligations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:16px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In addition, if the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly determine that Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s resolution plan is not credible, they could impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. Further, we could be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and could potentially result in the divestiture or restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:16px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Under the Financial Reform Act, when a G-SIB such as Bank of America Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution. In the event of such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. In 2013, the FDIC issued a notice describing its preferred &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy for resolving a G-SIB. Under this approach, the FDIC could replace Bank of America Corporation with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors. The FDIC&#8217;s &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:16px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information about resolution planning, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Item 1.

Economic or market stress or disruptions, including as a result of natural disasters, would likely increase the risk that borrowers or counterparties would default or become delinquent in their obligations to us, resulting in credit loss. Increases in delinquencies and default rates could adversely affect our consumer credit card, home equity, residential mortgage and purchased credit-impaired portfolios through increased charge-offs and provision for credit losses. A deteriorating economic environment could also adversely affect our consumer and commercial loan portfolios with weakened client and collateral positions. Additionally, simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit or an increase in a borrower&#8217;s leverage in a weakening economic environment could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio, should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations. Specifically, our consumer portfolio could be negatively impacted by drastic reductions in employment, or increases in underemployment, resulting in lower disposable income.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We estimate and establish an allowance for credit losses for losses inherent in our lending activities (including unfunded lending commitments), excluding those measured at fair value, through a charge to earnings. The process for determining the amount of the allowance requires us to make difficult and complex judgments, including loss forecasts on how borrowers will react to changing economic conditions. The ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations will likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. There is also the possibility that we will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or that we will fail to accurately estimate their impacts.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We may suffer unexpected losses if the models and assumptions we use to establish reserves and make judgments in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties prove inaccurate in predicting future events. In addition, external factors, such as natural disasters, can influence recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. Although we believe that our allowance for credit losses was in compliance with applicable accounting standards at </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">December 31, 2018</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate. In such an event, we may increase the size of our allowance which would reduce our earnings.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the ordinary course of our business, we also may be subject to a concentration of credit risk in a particular industry, geographic location, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses, and the processes by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries and countries may not function as we have anticipated. While our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurers, mutual funds and hedge funds, and other institutional clients.

Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses and defaults. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of default of a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us. Further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the ordinary course of business, we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities. Unfavorable economic or political conditions, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, changes in oil prices, social instability and changes in government policies could impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit risk.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We also have a concentration of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate, auto, consumer credit card and commercial real estate portfolios, which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio.

Conditions in the U.S. housing market in prior years resulted in both significant write-downs of asset values in several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed securities, and exposure to monolines. If the U.S. housing market were to weaken, the value of real estate could decline, which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses and negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We are party to a large number of derivatives transactions, including credit derivatives. Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa, may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. Certain of our OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change in the credit rating of a particular Bank of America entity or entities, we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other remedial actions, or our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In addition, in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings, certain derivative and other counterparties may request we substitute BANA (which has generally had equal or higher credit ratings than the parent company) as counterparty for certain contracts. Our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements may be subject to certain limitations including, counterparty willingness, operational considerations, regulatory limitations on having BANA as a counterparty and collateral constraints. It is possible that such limitations on our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements, including having BANA as the new counterparty, could adversely affect our results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Many derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling some positions difficult. Many derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold, and may not be able to obtain, the underlying security, loan or other obligation.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We are also a member of various central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs) due to regulatory requirements for mandatory clearing of derivative transactions, which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to CCPs. In the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults on its obligations, we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. Also, as a clearing member, we are exposed to the risk of non-performance by our clients for which we clear transactions, which may not be covered by available collateral.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">For more information on our derivatives exposure, see </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">to the Consolidated Financial Statements</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#e31837;font-weight:bold;">Geopolitical</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">We are subject to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We do business throughout the world, including in emerging markets.

These risks are especially elevated in emerging markets. A number of non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we do business have been or may be negatively impacted by slowing growth or recessionary conditions, market volatility and/or political unrest. The political and economic environment in Europe, including the debt concerns of certain EU countries, remains challenging and the current degree of political and economic uncertainty, including potential recessionary conditions, could increase. For example, the ongoing negotiations of the terms of the U.K.&#8217;s planned exit from the EU may create uncertainty and increase risk, which could adversely affect us. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Potential risks of default on or devaluation of sovereign debt in some non-U.S. jurisdictions could expose us to substantial losses. Risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations, including our U.S. operations. Market and economic disruptions of all types may affect consumer confidence levels and spending, corporate investment and job creation, bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt, economic growth rates and asset values, among other factors. Any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our company.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. Furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging markets, are generally smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments, securities exchanges and regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our potential inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation in general.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In addition to non-U.S. legislation, our international operations are also subject to U.S. legal requirements. For example, our operations are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, and economic sanctions, which can vary by jurisdiction. The increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds. Our ability to comply with these legal requirements depends on our ability to continually improve detection and reporting and analytic capabilities.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the U.S., debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, which have increased the possibility of U.S. government defaults on its debt and/or downgrades to its credit ratings, and prolonged government shutdowns could negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition, including our liquidity. Additionally, changes in fiscal, </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">monetary or regulatory policy could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations, organizational structure and results of operations.

Negotiations between the EU and U.K. regarding this exit consist of three phases: a withdrawal agreement, a new trade deal and an arrangement for a transition period. Significant political and economic uncertainty persists regarding the timing, details and viability of each phase. There may be heightened uncertainty if the terms of the U.K.&#8217;s exit from the EU are not agreed upon at the time of its exit. The ultimate impact and terms of the U.K.&#8217;s planned exit remain unclear, and short- and long-term global economic and market volatility may occur, including as a result of currency fluctuations and trade relations. If uncertainty resulting from the U.K.&#8217;s exit negatively impacts economic conditions, financial markets and consumer confidence, our business, results of operations, financial position and/or operational model could be adversely affected. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We are also subject to different laws, regulations and regulatory authorities and may incur additional costs and/or experience negative tax consequences as a result of establishing our principal EU banking and broker-dealer operations outside of the U.K., which could adversely impact our EU business, results of operations and operational model. Additionally, changes to the legal and regulatory framework under which our subsidiaries will continue to provide products and services in the U.K. following an exit by the U.K. from the EU may result in additional compliance costs and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

For example, technology project implementation challenges may cause business interruptions. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure or those of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third party&#8217;s control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume due to electronic trading platforms and algorithmic trading applications; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware or software; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods; pandemics; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, which could result in prolonged operational outages. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up. We continuously update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations globally. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">A cyber-attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our businesses are highly dependent on the security, controls and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of our customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties with whom we interact or on whom we rely. Our businesses rely on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, personal and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We, our employees and customers, regulators and other third parties have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code (such as ransomware), phishing attacks, denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties, damages to systems, or otherwise material disruption to our or our customers&#8217; or other third parties&#8217; network </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all cyber-attacks or information or security breaches, nor may we be able to implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address such attacks or breaches.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Cybersecurity risks for financial services organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new and emerging technologies, and the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings, expand our internal usage of web- or cloud-based products and applications and continue to develop our use of process automation and artificial intelligence. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increasingly sophisticated activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The techniques used by bad actors change frequently and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred, at which time the materiality of the breach may be difficult to assess. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Although to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such material losses or consequences in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale, and our role in the financial services industry and the broader economy, our plans to continue to implement our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, including our vendors and regulators, our geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, threats of cyber terrorism, external extremist parties, including foreign state actors, in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends, and system and customer account updates and conversions. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a critical priority. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including financial counterparties; </span></div></div></div><div><br/></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;"><div style="padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:99.609375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;"><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:34%;"></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="text-align:left;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Demi,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">11</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">&#160;</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;">Bank of America 2018</span></div><div style="text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:4px;text-align:left;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;"><br/></span></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><br/></div><div style='display:inline-block; width:100%;'><div style='float:left; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">financial intermediaries such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses; vendors; regulators; providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power; and retailers for whom we process transactions.

This consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach, termination or constraint of any third party, including downstream service providers, could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to conduct day-to-day business activities, effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, expand our businesses or result in the misappropriation or destruction of the personal, proprietary or confidential information of our employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in significant lost revenue, give rise to losses or have other negative consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. Also, successful penetration or circumvention of system security could result in negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, the withdrawal of customer deposits, prolonged computer and network outages resulting in disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or the confidential, proprietary or personal information of certain parties, such as our employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties, or damage to their computers or systems. This could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws in the U.S. and abroad, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered ineffective. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Our mortgage loan repurchase obligations or claims from third parties could result in additional losses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We and our legacy companies have sold significant amounts of residential mortgage loans.

If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which could cause us to lose servicing income. In addition, for loans principally held in private-label securitization trusts, we may have liability for any failure by us, as a servicer or master servicer, for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties. If any such breach was found to have occurred, it may harm our reputation, increase our servicing costs or adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, with respect to foreclosures, we may incur costs or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation, or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process.

We seek to effectively identify, measure, monitor, report and control the types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. While we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques, including hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses, our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify all risks, including emerging and unknown risks, anticipate the timing of risks, apply effective hedging strategies, manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently, and develop risk management models to assess and control risk.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our ability to manage risk is limited by our ability to develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the Corporation and manage risks associated with third parties and vendors, to enable effective risk management and ensure that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. Uncertain economic conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, may result in a heightened level of risk for us.

For example, under the provisions of the Financial Reform Act known as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; we are prohibited from proprietary trading and limited in our sponsorship of, and investment in, hedge funds, private equity funds and certain other covered private funds. Non-U.S. regulators, such as the U.K. financial regulators and the European Parliament and Commission, have adopted or proposed laws and regulations regarding financial institutions located in their jurisdictions, which have required and could require us to make significant modifications to our non-U.S. businesses, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We continue to make adjustments to our business and operations, legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies, procedures and controls to comply with these laws and regulations, as well as final rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities. Further, we could become subject to future regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated. The cumulative effect of all of the legislation and regulations on our business, operations and profitability remains uncertain. This uncertainty necessitates that in our business planning we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of the proposed rules. If these assumptions prove incorrect, we could be subject to increased regulatory and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm. In addition, U.S. and international regulatory initiatives may overlap, and non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed U.S. regulations, which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">Our regulators&#8217; prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions, and they have assumed an active oversight, inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry.

The amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have been substantial and may increase. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant consequences for a financial institution, including reputational harm, loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">The Corporation and its employees and representatives are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions. Additionally, the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of our operations and the aggressiveness of the regulatory environment worldwide also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Responding to inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and proceedings, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the attention of our senior management from our business. The outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings, which may last a number of years.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We are currently subject to the terms of settlements and consent orders that we have entered into with government agencies and regulatory authorities and may become subject to additional settlements or orders in the future. Such settlements and consent orders impose significant operational and compliance costs on us as they typically require us to enhance our procedures and controls, expand our risk and control functions within our lines of business, invest in technology and hire significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel. Moreover, if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements and orders to which we are subject, or more generally, to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government agencies, we could be required to enter into further settlements and orders, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to identify, assess, monitor and report on applicable laws, policies and procedures, compliance risks will continue to exist, particularly as we adapt to new rules and regulations. Additionally, there is no guarantee that our risk management and compliance programs will be consistently executed to successfully manage compliance risk. We also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk. Future legislative or regulatory actions, and any required changes to our business or operations, or those of third parties upon whom we rely, resulting from such developments and actions, could result in a significant loss of revenue, impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability, limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, require us to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets </span></div></div><div style='width:2%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">that we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. In addition, legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time that may result in fines, regulatory sanctions, penalties, equitable relief and changes to our business practices.

Greater than expected litigation and investigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have adverse effects on our financial condition, including liquidity, and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us. We continue to experience a significant volume of litigation and other disputes, including claims for contractual indemnification with counterparties regarding relative rights and responsibilities. Consumers, clients and other counterparties continue to be litigious. Among other things, financial institutions, including us, continue to be the subject of claims alleging anti-competitive conduct with respect to various products and markets, including U.S. antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages. In addition, regulatory authorities have had a supervisory focus on enforcement, including in connection with alleged violations of law and customer harm. For example, U.S. regulators and government agencies have pursued claims against financial institutions under </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#222222;">the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act,</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"> False Claims Act and antitrust laws.

For the duration of such an agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose restrictions on our activities. If we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement, or fail to comply with the terms of such agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities, including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.</span></div></div></div><div><br/></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;"><div style="padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;"><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td style="width:34%;"></td><td style="width:33%;"></td><td style="width:33%;"></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:top;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;"><div style="text-align:right;font-size:7pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;">Bank of America 2018 </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:7pt;">&#160;</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Demi,sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;">14</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"></hr><div><br/></div><div style='display:inline-block; width:100%;'><div style='float:left; width:49%;'><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">In the current regulatory environment, capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended. It is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including TLAC and long-term debt requirements, change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements. Our risk-based capital surcharge (G-SIB surcharge) may increase from current estimates, and we are also subject to a countercyclical capital buffer which, while currently set at zero, may be increased by regulators. In 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal to implement a stress capital buffer into its capital requirements, which may increase our regulatory capital requirements, if adopted. A significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our risk-weighted assets and our leverage exposure which may increase. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets, including a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk and constraints on the use of internal models, as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches. U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. In 2018, U.S. banking regulators published a proposal outlining a standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which updates the calculation of the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the regulatory capital rule. Additionally, Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements have been proposed, which would apply to us and our subsidiary depository institutions, and target longer term liquidity risk. While the impact of these proposals remains uncertain, they could have a negative impact on our capital and liquidity positions.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:17px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">As part of its annual CCAR review, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve.

Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements. Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards, the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied.

The standard replaces the existing measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which is based on management&#8217;s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Corporation&#8217;s lending activities, with management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation&#8217;s financial assets that are recognized at amortized cost. The standard will also expand credit quality disclosures. The impact of this new accounting standard may be an increase in the Corporation&#8217;s allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption which would result in a negative adjustment to retained earnings. The ultimate impact will depend on the characteristics of the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio at adoption date as well as the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts as of that date.

Additionally, the changing regulatory environment may create competitive disadvantages for us given geography-driven capital and liquidity requirements. For example, U.S. regulators have in certain instances adopted stricter capital and liquidity requirements than those applicable to non-U.S. institutions. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to compete.

There is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services on more attractive terms, including higher interest rates on deposits, which may impact our ability to grow revenue and/or effectively compete. Additionally legislative and regulatory developments may affect the competitive landscape. Further, the competitive landscape may be impacted by the growth of non-depository institutions that offer traditional banking products at higher rates or with no fees, or otherwise offer alternative products. This can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our online and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions. We may not be as timely or successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers.

The models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. We could suffer losses if models and strategies fail to properly anticipate and manage risks.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Medium,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;">Failure to properly manage and aggregate data may result in our inability to manage risk and business needs and inaccurate financial, regulatory and operational reporting.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:18px;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;">We rely on our ability to manage, aggregate, interpret and use data in an accurate, timely and complete manner for effective risk reporting and management.

This announcement, in conjunction with financial benchmark reforms more generally and changes in the interbank lending markets, have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and certain other rates or indices which are used as interest rate &#8220;benchmarks&#8221; in many of our products and contracts, including floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate products. These actions and uncertainties may have the effect of triggering future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks or lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks. ICE Benchmark Administration is the administrator of LIBOR and maintains a reference panel of contributor banks, which includes BANA London branch for certain LIBOR rates. Uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions, and the potential or actual discontinuation of benchmark quotes, may adversely affect the value of, return on and trading market for our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to benchmarks, including any LIBOR-based securities, loans and derivatives, or our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for an actual discontinuation of benchmarks, including LIBOR, that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to benchmarks will transition successfully to alternative reference rates or benchmarks or of the timing of adoption and degree of integration of such alternative reference rates or benchmarks in the markets. The discontinuation of benchmarks, including LIBOR, may have an unpredictable impact on the contractual mechanics of outstanding securities, loans, derivatives or other products (including, but not limited to, interest rates to be paid to or by us), require renegotiation of outstanding financial assets and liabilities, adversely affect the return on such outstanding products, cause significant disruption to financial markets that are relevant to our business segments, particularly </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#231f20;font-style:italic;">Global Banking</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#231f20;"> and </span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#231f20;font-style:italic;">Global Markets</span><span style="font-family:Franklin Gothic Book,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#231f20;">, increase the risk of litigation and/or increase expenses related to the transition to alternative reference rates or benchmarks, among other adverse consequences. Additionally, any transition from current benchmarks may alter the Corporation&#8217;s risk profiles and models, valuation tools, product design and effectiveness of hedging strategies, as well as increase the costs and risks related to potential regulatory requirements. Reforms to and uncertainty regarding transitions from current benchmarks may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.</span></div></div></div><div><a id="sADF7A25C98D551D1AEC13D8FED839A76"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;font-size:12pt;">
