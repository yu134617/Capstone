In particular, global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, changes in gross domestic product (GDP), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, challenging labor market conditions, wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies, a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity, the continued transition from InterBank Offered Rates (IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the impact of volatility of digital assets on the broader market, the growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure, recessionary fears and investor sentiment. Global markets, including energy and commodity markets, may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, military conflict, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our liquidity. Any sudden or prolonged market downturn, as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. High inflation, elevated interest rate levels, supply chain disruptions, and the Russia/Ukraine conflict, including the related energy impact in Europe, have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in additional market volatility and disruptions.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Global uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges.

Monetary policy in response to high inflation has led to a significant increase in market interest rates and a flattening and/or inversion of the yield curve. This has resulted in and may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets, further volatility of the U.S. dollar, a widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates and recessionary concerns, and could result in elevated unemployment, which could impact investor risk appetite and our borrowers, potentially increasing delinquency rates. It is also possible that high inflation may limit the scope of monetary support, including cuts to the federal funds rate, in the event of an economic downturn, resulting in a more protracted period of a flat and/or inverted yield curve.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest rates would likely result in lower revenue through lower net interest income, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, climate change (including efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely impact U.S. or global economic activity and our customers', our counterparties' and our earnings and operations. Globally, many central banks are simultaneously reducing monetary accommodation through interest rate or balance sheet policy, which has contributed and may continue to contribute to elevated financial and capital market volatility and significant changes to asset values. While higher interest rates have positively impacted our net interest income, higher interest rates have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact deposits, loan demand and funding costs. If the U.S. government&#8217;s debt ceiling limit is not raised, the ramifications could result in market volatility, ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions. This could have a negative and potentially severe impact on the U.S. and world economy and financial and capital markets, including higher interest rates, higher volatility, lower asset values, lower liquidity, downgrades to U.S. debt, and a weakened U.S. dollar.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Changes to international trade and investment policies by the U.S. could negatively impact financial markets.

The value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates or credit spreads could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. Changes to fiscal policy, including expansion of U.S. federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance, could also affect market interest rates. If interest rates decrease, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, including future revenue and earnings growth.

In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa. Such changes to the relationship between market parameters may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. Changes in correlation can be exacerbated where market participants use risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists. Where we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, or where the degree of accessible liquidity declines significantly, we may not be able to reduce our positions and risks associated with such holdings, so we may suffer larger than expected losses when adverse price movements take place. This risk can be exacerbated where we hold a position that is large relative to the available liquidity. </span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If asset values decline, we may incur losses and negative impacts to capital and liquidity requirements.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including loans and loan commitments, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, derivative assets and liabilities, debt securities, marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and are subject to valuation and impairment assessments.

Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions, and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets (RWA), which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. Values of AUM also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for asset-based management and performance fees.

We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets, illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets, the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements (including as a result of credit concerns for short-term borrowing), changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile, prolonged federal government shutdowns, or changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that impact our funding. Additionally, our liquidity or cost of funds may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort, unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit, slower customer payment rates, restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients, the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds (which could result from attrition driven by customers seeking higher yielding deposits or securities products, customer desire to utilize an alternative financial institution perceived to be safer, changes in customer spending behavior due to inflation, decline in the economy or other drivers resulting in an increased need for cash), increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries, which could result in the inability to transfer liquidity internally and inefficient funding, changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or </span></div></div></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">9</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%"> Bank of America</span></div></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div style="text-align:justify"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="width:100.000%"><div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;width:48.706%"><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">default by a significant market participant or third party (including clearing agents, custodians, central banks or central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs)).

Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s preferred resolution strategy is a &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy, whereby only the parent holding company would file for bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Certain key operating subsidiaries would be provided with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company. Bank of America Corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries. Pursuant to these arrangements, if Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent, it will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary. This could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including the ability to meet our payment obligations and the ability to return capital to shareholders, including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly determine that Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s resolution plan is not credible, they could impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations.

Additionally, the FDIC could replace Bank of America Corporation with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors.

Credit risk could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or declining asset prices, including property or collateral values, unrelated to macroeconomic stress.

However, we cannot predict the future prospects of the GSEs, timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship, or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs in the housing market. If the GSEs take a reduced role in the marketplace, including by limiting the mortgage products they offer, we could be required to seek alternative funding sources, retain additional loans on our balance sheet, secure funding through the Federal Home Loan Bank system, or securitize the loans through Private Label Securitization, which could increase our cost of funds related to the origination of new mortgage loans, increase credit risk and/or impact our capacity to originate new mortgage loans. Uncertainty regarding their future and the MBS they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future. These developments could adversely affect our securities portfolios, capital levels, liquidity and results of operations.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to effectively and consistently identify, measure, monitor, report and control the key types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Additionally, risks may span across multiple key risk types, including climate risk and legal risk. While we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques, including modeling and forecasting, hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses, our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify and measure all risks, including emerging and unknown risks, anticipate the timing and impact of risks, apply effective hedging strategies, make correct assumptions, manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently, identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data and develop risk management models and forecasts to assess and control risk.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program and develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the Corporation and manage risks associated with third parties, including providers of products and/or services, enable effective risk management and help confirm that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry, the pace of technological changes, accounting and market developments, the failure of employees, representatives and third parties to comply with our policies and Risk Framework and the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have in the past and may in the future result in a heightened level of risk. For example, we have experienced increased operational, reputational and compliance risk as a result of the prior need to rapidly deploy and implement multiple and varying pandemic relief programs, including the processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states, which have resulted in and will continue to result in losses. Our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate, manage, control or mitigate risks could result in additional losses.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span><br/></span></div></div></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.233%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:32.234%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:0 1pt"></td><td colspan="3" style="padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="text-align:right"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Bank of America </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%"> </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:7pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">16</span></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div style="text-align:justify"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="width:100.000%"><div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;width:48.706%"><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e31837;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Regulatory, Compliance and Legal</span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We are subject to evolving government legislation and regulations and certain settlements, orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We are subject to evolving and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including increasing and complex regulatory sanctions regimes.

ARRs have compositions and characteristics that differ from the benchmarks they replace, in some cases they have limited liquidity, and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace. For example, certain ARRs are calculated on a compounded or weighted-average basis and, unlike IBORs, do not reflect bank credit risk and therefore typically require a spread adjustment. There are important differences between the fallbacks, triggers and calculation methodologies being implemented in cash and derivatives markets. Any mismatch between the adoption of ARRs in loans, securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented, and we may experience unanticipated market exposures. Changes resulting from transition to successor or alternative rates may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into, the value of such loans, securities or derivative instruments, the trading market for such products and contracts, and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk.

Our models may also be adversely impacted by human error and may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee and review them at regular intervals and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes, they contain erroneous data, assumptions, valuations, formulas or algorithms or our applications running the models do not perform as expected. Regardless of the steps we take to help confirm effective controls, governance, monitoring and testing, and implement new technology and automated processes, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm, including funding or liquidity shortfalls, if models fail to properly anticipate and manage risks. </span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Failure to properly manage data may result in our inability to manage risk and business needs, errors in our operations, critical reporting and strategic decision-making, inaccurate reporting and non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We rely on our ability to manage and process data in an accurate, timely and complete manner, including capturing, transporting, aggregating, using, transmitting data externally, and retaining and protecting data appropriately. While we continually update our policies, programs, processes and practices and implement emerging technologies, such as automation, AI and robotics, our data management processes may not be effective and are subject to weaknesses and failures, including human error, data limitations, process delays, system failure or failed controls. Failure to properly manage data effectively in an accurate, timely and complete manner may adversely impact its quality and reliability and our ability to manage current and emerging risk, produce accurate financial and non-financial, regulatory and operational reporting, detect or surveil potential misconduct or non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations, as well as to manage changing business needs, strategic decision-making, resolution strategy and operations. The failure to establish and maintain effective, efficient and controlled data management could adversely impact our ability to develop our products and relationships with our customers, increase regulatory risk and operational losses, and damage our reputation.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our operations, businesses and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts related to climate change.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Climate change and related environmental sustainability matters present short-term and long-term risks to us. The physical risks include an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels. Such disasters could impact our facilities and employees and disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties, and result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers&#8217; ability to repay outstanding loans, result in rapid deposit outflows or drawdowns of credit facilities, cause supply chain and/or distribution network disruptions, damage collateral or result in the deterioration of the value of collateral or insurance shortfalls.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There is also increasing risk related to the transition to a low-carbon economy.

We have devoted and expect to continue to devote additional resources as a result of our response to climate change. Our climate change strategies, policies, and disclosures, our ability to achieve our climate-related goals, targets and commitments, and/or the environmental or climate impacts attributable to our products, transactions or services will likely result in heightened legal and compliance risk and could result in reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence. Our ability to meet our climate-related goals, targets and commitments, including our goal to achieve certain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets by 2030 and net zero GHG emissions in our financing activities, operations and supply chain before 2050, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as technology advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies and better emissions data reporting, and ongoing engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There are and will continue to be challenges related to capturing, verifying, analyzing and disclosing climate-related data, which includes nonfinancial data and other information that is subject to measurement uncertainties, may not be independently verified, and may result in legal or reputational harm.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees is critical to our success, business prospects and competitive position.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our performance and competitive position is heavily dependent on the talents, development and efforts of highly skilled individuals.

Furthermore, because a substantial portion of our annual incentive compensation paid to many of our employees is long-term equity-based awards based on the value of our common stock, declines in our profitability or outlook could adversely affect the ability to attract and retain employees.
