To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays, uncertainties, unpredictabilities, and inconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches, lost market opportunity, potential impairment of inventories, and other negative impacts. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and indications.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful. </span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or line extensions for existing products, both through our internal efforts and our business development activities, sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls, lose intellectual property exclusivity, or are displaced by competing products or therapies.

There are substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions. Increased focus on business combinations in our industry, including by the Federal Trade Commission and competition authorities in Europe and other jurisdictions, and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay, jeopardize or increase the costs of our business development activities. In addition, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses, products, or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, information security, manufacturing, distribution, and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges.

Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We have faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection. For example, following the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan in June 2021, we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenue from current levels in these markets. In addition, as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity for Alimta in in the first half of 2022, we began facing, and expect to continue to face, generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current levels.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. For non-biologic products, loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the U.S. For biologics (such as Humalog, Humulin, Erbitux, Cyramza, Trulicity, Taltz, and Emgality), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. Generic pharmaceutical companies could also introduce a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. In addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Executive Overview&#8212;Other Matters&#8212;Patent Matters," and Item 1, "Business&#8212;Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights," for more details. </span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">&#8226;</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected. </span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines. Without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development, as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs and indications to the market. Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time, depending on local laws and regulations. Changes to such laws, regulations, and enforcement practices could reduce protections for our innovative products and indications. For example, potential reforms to pharmaceutical legislation in the European Union may threaten the predictability and length of certain pharmaceutical intellectual property incentives. Changes proposed by the USPTO to limit the number of, and differences between, patents obtained could also affect the scope of patent protection for our products in the U.S. Also in the U.S., in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCIA, which applies to biologic products, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering pharmaceutical products. As a result, we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products, including biologics, will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation </span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">25</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">and may not be upheld. In addition, a separate IPR process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use IPR proceedings as an alternative to Hatch-Waxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain. Recently, the USPTO issued an interim procedure regarding the use of discretionary denials of IPR proceedings when there is parallel district court litigation. However, it is not clear how this interim procedure could affect the ability of our competitors to institute IPR proceedings after institution of litigation. If our patents are challenged through this expedited review process, even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent, our win provides limited precedential value at the PTAB and no precedential value in federal district court, meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors. We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. In addition, intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weak and we face additional risks to our intellectual property rights, including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch.

To compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. Our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. Our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations, including new modalities, that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for biosimilars, health authority guidelines and legislative actions could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars. In the U.S., the FDA has issued several "interchangeability" designations for biosimilar products, and is expected to continue doing so in the future. These designations could &#8211; subject to state law requirements &#8211; enable pharmacies to substitute biosimilars for innovator biological products. Given the importance of biologic products to our clinical-stage pipeline, such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1, "Business&#8212;Competition" and "Business&#8212;Research and Development," for more details.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, we rely on our ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel in order to compete effectively.

Our ability to attract and retain talent in our increasingly competitive environment may be further complicated by evolving employment trends, including as related to increased preferences for remote or flexible work arrangements; public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; political, social, civil, or cultural unrest; emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war and unrest; or the threat of or perceived potential for any of the foregoing events.

Unassociated third parties present further risks, including by propagating misinformation related to our products, business, and industry. The healthcare industry has been and continues to be a target for cyber-attacks, and the number of threats has increased over time.

Trade and other global disputes and interruptions in international relationships, including related to tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments, unrest or war, as well as public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affect our ability to do business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. As a further example, the financial impact of higher energy prices, defense spending, and inflation due, in part, to the Russia-Ukraine war and resulting geopolitical and economic disruptions, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, has further exacerbated financial pressures on governments with single-payer or government funded healthcare systems, leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates, clawbacks, and other reforms to reimbursement systems, particularly in Europe. These and similar events have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, us, our business partners, and our customers.

After approval, the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients. Accordingly, we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. In addition, we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. New safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. Serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval have, and could in the future, result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. Safety issues have, and could in the future, result in costly product liability claims. </span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">28</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">&#8226;</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">We face litigation and investigations related to our products, how we price our products, and how we commercialize our products; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business, and we are self-insured for such matters. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We are subject to a substantial number of claims involving various current and historical products, litigation and investigations.

Manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at our facilities or those of our contractors and suppliers, the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, or increases in demand on a supplier could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our products and/or product shortages, leading to lost revenue. In select cases, supply constraints may also lead to pauses, discontinuations or other product availability issues in one or more markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Further, cost inflation and global transportation and logistics challenges, as well as tight labor markets, have caused, and in the future may cause, delays in, and/or increase costs related to, distribution of our medicines, the construction or other acquisition of manufacturing capacity, procurement activity, and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. Such difficulties, disruptions, or challenges could result from quality, oversight, or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters (including increased instances of natural disasters or other events that may be due to climate change), public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic); periods of global economic downturn or uncertainty; emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war); equipment, mechanical, data, or IT system vulnerabilities, such as system inadequacies, inadequate controls or procedures, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources; labor shortages; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; or inability to obtain single-source or other raw or intermediate materials. Regional dependencies may in some cases accentuate risks related to manufacturing and supply. For example, we, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, depend on China-based partners for integral chemical synthesis, reagents, starting materials, and ingredients.</span></div><div style="padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity have resulted, and in the future may result, in difficulty meeting demand for, or disruptions, shortages, and higher costs in the supply of, our products. For example, we have experienced challenges in meeting demand for our incretin products, partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies. Despite our ongoing efforts to meet significant expected demand by obtaining additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity, there can be no assurances that such capacity increases will be realized as expected. Delays or challenges in operationalizing additional manufacturing capacity would limit our ability to capitalize on expected demand. Conversely, unexpected contingencies that limit demand for our incretin products would undermine our ability to realize the full benefit of significant capital expenditures that we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, to augment manufacturing capacity and may also subject us to contractual payment obligations. The foregoing risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and reputation.

In particular, Trulicity accounted for 26 percent of our total revenues in 2022 and we expect GLP-1s, including Mounjaro, which we launched in 2022, to represent a significant and growing portion of our business. Loss of patent protection, changes in prescription rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects or safety concerns, significant changes in demand, regulatory proceedings, negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing or new competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing, and access pressures, or supply shortages or disruptions for these products or any of our other major products could materially impact our results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, in the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers and if one of these significant wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us or we might be unable to timely collect the amounts that the wholesaler owes us, which could negatively impact our results of operations.

Such stakeholders have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools favoring the use of generic products. As these practices expand, including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. private third-party payers, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain stakeholders will continue to increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.

In addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP, quality assurance, evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and </span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">32</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our business. Regulatory compliance and processes in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may also be less predictable and result in additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. See Item 1, "Business&#8212;Government Regulation of Our Operations," for more details. </span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Furthermore, there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, sustainable manufacturing, human rights and equity matters, and disclosure regarding the foregoing, many of which may be ambiguous, inconsistent, dynamic or conflicting. We expect to experience increased restrictions and compliance costs, legal costs, and expenses related to such new or changing legal or regulatory requirements. Moreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements would require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters. In addition, we may still be subject to penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Additionally, we are subject to increased negative attention from the media, stockholders, activists, and other stakeholders on climate change, social, and sustainability matters. The perception that we have failed to act in a socially responsible manner, whether or not valid, results in adverse publicity that can negatively affect our business and reputation, as well as result in increased scrutiny from legislators and regulatory authorities. Moreover, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments, including to reduce our impact on the environment. Our ability to achieve any stated environmental, social or governance goal, target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements, the availability of requisite financing, and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other goals. If we fail to achieve, are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving, or improperly report our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments, it could negatively affect our reputation or investor confidence, and expose us to enforcement actions and litigation.</span></div><div style="height:45pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">33</span></div></div></div><div id="i909b702f7db044078a8e3e150503788d_22"></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:45pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-36pt">
