Many jurisdictions have enacted such regulations. These regulations have established, and could further expand, obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer to financial institutions for consumers, the countries in which our integrated products and services may be used, the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services. New regulations and oversight could also relate to our clearing and settlement activities (including risk management policies and procedures, collateral requirements, participant default policies and procedures, the ability to complete timely switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resource requirements). In addition, several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;">&#32;</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry and, in some cases, are considering designating certain payments networks as &#8220;systemically important payment systems&#8221; or &#8220;critical infrastructure.&#8221; </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">19</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;" href="#sDAC4B7A49FF35AFCAB0A36238E1090CE"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">These obligations, designations and restrictions may further expand and could conflict with each other as more jurisdictions impose oversight of payment systems. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Some enacted regulations require financial institutions to provide third party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts. This may enable these third party payment processors to route transactions away from Mastercard products by offering account information or payment initiation services directly to people who currently use our products. This may also allow these processors to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions. New authentication standards have been enacted requiring additional verification information from consumers to complete transactions. This may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience. An increase in the rate of abandoned transactions could adversely impact our volumes or other operational metrics.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Increased regulation and oversight of payment systems may result in costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. Such laws or compliance burdens could result in issuers and acquirers being less willing to participate in our payments system, reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products (making our products less desirable to consumers), reduce the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions or other operational metrics, disintermediate us, impact our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services, all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance. Regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for changes to its system rules, procedures or operations, or could require customization with regard to such changes, which could impact market participant risk and therefore risk to us. Such regulatory changes could lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system by financial institutions or other customers. Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Increased regulatory, legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of our products. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products. If interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our products or route debit transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoting our integrated products and services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates on balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Governments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation, competition law, central bank regulation and litigation. See &#8220;Government Regulation&#8221; and</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;color:#0000ff;">&#32;</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings)</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">&#32;to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">If issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange rates, issuers may be less willing to participate in our four-party payments system, or may reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products, reducing the attractiveness of our products to consumers. In particular, potential changes to interregional interchange fees as a result of the proposed resolution of the European Commission&#8217;s investigation could impact our cross-border transaction activity disproportionately versus competitors that are not subject to similar reductions. These and other impacts could lower transaction volumes, and/or make proprietary three-party networks or other forms of payment more attractive. Issuers could reduce the benefits associated with our products or choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services. In addition, issuers could seek to decrease the expense of their payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge to them, particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge. This could make our products less desirable to consumers, reduce the volume of transactions and our profitability, and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative activity. The potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates, any resulting legislation, regulation and/or litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. In addition, regulatory proceedings and litigation could result (and in some cases has resulted) in us being fined and/or having to pay civil damages, the amount of which could be material.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">20</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;" href="#sDAC4B7A49FF35AFCAB0A36238E1090CE"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Current regulatory activity could be extended to additional jurisdictions or products, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Regulators around the world increasingly replicate other regulators&#8217; approaches with regard to the regulation of payments and other industries. Consequently, regulation in any one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries, states or regions. Similarly, new laws and regulations within a country, state or region involving one product may lead to regulation of similar or related products. For example, regulations affecting debit transactions could lead to regulation of other products (such as credit).</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">As a result, the risks to our business created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involve other products within any particular jurisdiction. These include matters like interchange rates, potential direct regulation of our network fees and pricing, network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements. Conversely, if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty adjusting our products, services, fees and other important aspects of our business to meet the varying requirements. Either of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We have historically implemented policies, referred to as no-surcharge rules, in certain jurisdictions, including the United States, that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our products instead of other means. Authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these no-surcharge rules (or indicated interest in doing so). Additionally, we have modified our no-surcharge rules to permit U.S. merchants to surcharge credit cards, subject to certain limitations. It is possible that over time merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change. This could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably and/or using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products, which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes, and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:14pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold;">Preferential or Protective Government Actions</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Preferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Governments in some countries have acted, or in the future may act, to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and switching providers, or have created, or may in the future create, their own national provider. This action may displace us from, prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies, and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers.

This expansion could amplify the impact of these regulations on our business. Regulation of privacy and data protection and information security often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transfer and/or security of personal and sensitive information. We are also subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirements in the European Union, and policymakers around the globe are using these requirements as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy laws that could result in similar or stricter requirements in other jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions are also considering requirements to collect, process and/or store data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting sector-specific regulations for the payments industry, including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements that overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general privacy rules. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and requirements could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">New requirements or reinterpretations of existing requirements in these areas, or the development of new regulatory schemes related to the digital economy in general, may also increase our costs and could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring, the development of information-based products and solutions and technology operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment products, which may, in turn, decrease the number of our payment products that they issue. Moreover, due to account data compromise events and privacy abuses by other companies, as well as the disclosure of monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies in combination with the use of artificial intelligence and new technologies, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirements and/or future enforcement. Those developments have also raised public attention on companies&#8217; data practices and have changed consumer and societal expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection. Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition, fraudulent activity could encourage regulatory intervention, which could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services or increase our compliance costs. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture consumer account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud. As outsourcing and specialization become common in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products. While we are taking measures to make card and digital payments more secure, increased fraud levels involving our integrated products and services, or misconduct or negligence by third parties switching or otherwise servicing our integrated products and services, could lead to regulatory intervention, such as enhanced security requirements, as well as damage to our reputation. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:14pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold;">Other Regulation </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Regulations that directly or indirectly apply to Mastercard as a result of our participation in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our integrated products and services are used.

In addition, if there is a delay in the implementation of our products or services or if our products or services do not perform as anticipated, we could face additional regulatory scrutiny, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as negatively impact our brand and reputation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:14pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold;">Information Security and Service Disruptions</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Information security risks for payments and technology companies such as ours have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error or accidental technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches and could lead to the misappropriation of consumer account and other information and identity theft.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks.

We, like other financial technology organizations, routinely are subject to cyber-threats and our technologies, systems and networks have been subject to attempted cyber-attacks. Because of our position in the payments value chain, we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks. Additionally, geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">To date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However, future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our integrated products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data information) or data security compromises. Such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added services), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties. In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Despite various mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future, or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payments and technology industries, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and account holders when and how they want to be served, our global presence, our extensive use of third-party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition to information security risks for our systems, we also routinely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transaction data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of account holders. Further events of this type may subject us to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands. Damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services. Such events could also slow or reverse the trend toward electronic payments. In addition to reputational concerns, the cumulative impact of multiple account data compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such events by, among other things, making it more difficult to identify consumers. Moreover, while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could still face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could materially affect our overall business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our transaction switching systems and other offerings may experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions, fire, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events. Our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists, activists, or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities and/or systems. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets. If one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks, because of the intrinsic importance of our switching systems to our business, any interruption or </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">27</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;" href="#sDAC4B7A49FF35AFCAB0A36238E1090CE"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:14pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold;">Financial Institution Customers and Other Stakeholder Relationships</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest financial institution customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Most of our financial institution customer relationships are not exclusive and may be terminated by our customers. Our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future and/or develop their own competitive services. Accordingly, our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition, a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest financial institution customers.

In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors. Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned. A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Consolidation</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">&#32;</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">in the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The banking industry has undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation in the past. Consolidations have included customers with a substantial Mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor. If significant consolidation among customers were to continue, it could result in the substantial loss of business for us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects. In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business. Consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers. These developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and, in many jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">While we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system, including merchants, governments and large digital companies and other technology companies, we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers&#8217; success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk.

We rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase revenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence. We believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations. See our risk factor in &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to Our Participation in the Payments Industry&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry regulation, including interchange fees. The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment, including in connection with the growth of digital payments, may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Certain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-branded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">As we increase our work with national, state and local governments, both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments.

In each case, decreased cross-border activity could decrease the revenue we receive. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations.</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;"><sup style="vertical-align:top;line-height:120%;font-size:pt"> </sup>&#160;</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">During </font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">2018</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">, approximately </font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">67%</font><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">&#32;of our revenue was generated from activities outside the United States. This revenue (and the related expense) could be transacted in a non-functional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. Our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In addition, some of the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluation of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue, this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into U.S. dollars, such as what we have experienced in Venezuela.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">The United Kingdom&#8217;s proposed withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. (commonly referred to as &#8220;Brexit&#8221;). The U.K. government triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29, 2017, which commenced the official E.U. withdrawal process. Uncertainty over the terms of the U.K.&#8217;s departure from the E.U. could cause political and economic uncertainty in the U.K. and the rest of Europe, which could harm our business and financial results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the U.K. and E.U. We, as well as our clients who have significant operations in the U.K., may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the E.U. We may also face additional complexity with regard to immigration and travel rights for our employees located in the U.K. and the E.U. These factors may impact our ability to operate in the E.U. and U.K. seamlessly. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could harm our business and financial results. </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">30</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;" href="#sDAC4B7A49FF35AFCAB0A36238E1090CE"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:14pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold;">Brand and Reputational Impact</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Negative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry. Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers, merchants or other organizations that impact the perception of our brands or the payments industry in general. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as &#8220;predatory&#8221;. Moreover, adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny. We have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace. Under some circumstances, our use of social media, or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes, could also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us, our products or merchants or other end users who utilize our products. Also, as we are headquartered in the United States, a negative perception of the United States could impact the perception of our company, which could adversely affect our business. Such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Lack of visibility of our brand in our products and services, or in the products and services of our partners who use our technology, may materially and adversely affect our business. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">As more players enter the global payments system, the layers between our brand and consumers and merchants increase. In order to compete with other powerful consumer brands that are also becoming part of the consumer payment experience, we often partner with those brands on payment solutions. These brands include large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers and use our networks to build their own acceptance brands. In some cases, our brand may not be featured in the payment solution or may be secondary to other brands. Additionally, as part of our relationships with some issuers, our payment brand is only included on the back of the card. As a result, our brand may either be invisible to consumers or may not be the primary brand with which consumers associate the payment experience. This brand invisibility, or any consumer confusion as to our role in the consumer payment experience, could decrease the value of our brand, which could adversely affect our business. </font></div><div style="line-height:174%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:14pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold;">Talent and Culture</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">We may not be able to attract, hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, or maintain our corporate culture, which could impact our ability to grow effectively.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key personnel and senior management. We may be unable to retain or to attract highly qualified employees. The market for key personnel is highly competitive, particularly in technology and other skill areas significant to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations and related enforcement have made it difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork could harm our overall business and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">We rely on key personnel to lead with integrity.

In addition, such an integration may divert management&#8217;s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Moreover, we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations, including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">31</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;" href="#sDAC4B7A49FF35AFCAB0A36238E1090CE"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply. This compliance could increase our costs, and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements. Our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:16pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:16pt;font-weight:bold;">Class A Common Stock and Governance Structure</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions and have an impact on change-in-control.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions, including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control, which could harm our stock price. For example, subject to limited exceptions, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15% of any of the Class A common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power, or more than 15% of our total voting power.

Mastercard Foundation is permitted to sell all of its remaining shares after May 1, 2027, subject to certain conditions. The directors of Mastercard Foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers. The ownership of Class A common stock by Mastercard Foundation, together with the restrictions on transfer, could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the Class A common stock. In addition, because Mastercard Foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time, it may not have the same interest in short or medium-term movements in our stock price as, or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to, our other stockholders. </font></div><div><a name="sEA984F1F96CD51609BD7E0AE52AE2741"></a></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:16pt;">
