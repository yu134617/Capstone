These efforts established, and potentially further expand, obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer, the countries in which our integrated products and services may be used, the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services. New regulations and oversight could also relate to our clearing and settlement activities (including policies, procedures and requirements related to risk management, collateral, participant default, timely switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resource). Several jurisdictions have also inquired about the network fees we charge to our customers (in some cases as part of broader market reviews of retail payments). </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world have also increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry. In several jurisdictions, we have been designated as a &#8220;systemically important payment system&#8221;, with other regulators considering similar designations. Parts of our business have also been deemed as a &#8220;specified service provider&#8221; and considered critical national infrastructure. These obligations, designations and restrictions result in heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny. They may further expand and could conflict with each other as more jurisdictions impose oversight of payments systems. Moreover, these efforts may influence the approaches of other regulators around the world that are increasingly looking to replicate similar regulation of payments and other industries. Similarly, jurisdictions that regulate a particular product may extend their regulation to similar products (for example, debit regulations could lead to regulation of credit products or network fees). As a result, the risks to our business created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involve other products within any particular jurisdiction. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">The expansion of our products and services as part of our multi-rail strategy have also created the need for us to obtain new types and increasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those imposed on our core payment network activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer licenses to support certain activities. These licenses typically impose supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital, safeguarding, risk management and other business obligations. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Increased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our products and services, have resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. As a result, customers could be less willing to participate in our payments system and/or use our other products or services, reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products (making our products less desirable to consumers), reduce the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions or other operational metrics, disintermediate us, impact our profitability and/or limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services, all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, any regulation that is enacted related to the type and level of network fees we charge our customers could also materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for changes to our system rules, procedures or operations, or could require customization with regard to such changes, which could negatively impact us. Such changes could lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system by financial institutions or other customers. Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Increased regulatory, legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of products associated with our core payment network. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products. If interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our products or route transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoting our integrated products and services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates on balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Governments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation, competition law, central bank regulation and litigation.

These and other impacts could lower transaction volumes, and/or make proprietary three-party networks or other forms of payment more attractive. Issuers could reduce the benefits associated with our products or choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services. In addition, issuers could seek a fee reduction from us to decrease the expense of their payment programs, particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge. This could make our products less desirable to consumers, reduce the volume of transactions and our profitability, and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">We are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative activity. The potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates, any resulting legislation, regulation and/or litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these no-surcharge rules (or indicated interest in doing so). Additionally, we have modified our no-surcharge rules to permit U.S. and Canadian merchants to surcharge credit cards, subject to certain limitations. It is possible that over time merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change. This could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably and/or using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products, which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes, and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff671b;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Preferential or Protective Government Actions</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Preferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Governments in some countries have acted, or in the future may act, to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and switching providers, or have created, or may in the future create, their own national provider.

These regulations could result in negative impacts to our business. As we continue to develop integrated and personalized products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace (as well as acquire new companies), we have expanded our information profile through the collection of additional data from additional sources and across multiple channels. This expansion has amplified the impact of these regulations on our business. This regulation requires monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transfer and/or protection of personal and sensitive information, as well as increased care in our data management, governance and quality practices. We are also subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirements in the European Union, and policymakers around the globe are or are considering adopting new or updated privacy laws that have resulted or could result in similar or stricter requirements in other jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions have implemented or are otherwise considering requirements to collect, process and/or store data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are otherwise considering adopting sector-specific regulations for the payments industry, including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements, as well as regulations on artificial intelligence and data governance, that overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general privacy rules. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and requirements could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">New requirements or changing interpretations of existing requirements in these areas, or the development of new regulatory schemes related to the digital economy in general, may also increase our costs and/or restrict our ability to leverage data for innovation. This could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring, the need for improved data management, governance and quality practices, the development of information-based products and solutions, and technology operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment products, which may, in turn, decrease the number of our payment products that they issue. Moreover, due to account data compromise events and privacy abuses by other companies, as well as the disclosure of monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies in combination with the use of artificial intelligence and new technologies, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirements and/or future enforcement. Those developments have also raised public attention on companies&#8217; data practices and have changed consumer and societal expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection. While we make every effort to comply with all regulatory requirements and we deploy a Privacy by Design and Data by Design approach to all of our product development, the speed and pace of changes in laws (as well as stakeholder interests) may not allow us to meet rapidly evolving regulatory and stakeholder expectations. Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">In addition, fraudulent activity and increasing cyberattacks have encouraged legislative and regulatory intervention, and could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services or increase our compliance costs. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture consumer personal information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud. As outsourcing and specialization become common in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products. While we are taking measures to make card and digital payments more secure, increased fraud levels involving our integrated products and services, or misconduct or negligence by third parties switching or otherwise servicing our integrated products and services, could lead to legislative or regulatory intervention, such as enhanced security requirements and liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff671b;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Other Regulation </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Regulations that directly or indirectly apply to Mastercard as a result of our participation in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our integrated products and services are used.

Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems, or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products.

Additionally, our compliance with new economic sanctions and related laws with respect to particular jurisdictions or customers could result in a loss of business, which could be significant. Moreover, while our risk-based compliance program obligates issuers and acquirers to comply with their local sanctions programs (among other obligations), the failure of those issuers and acquirers to identify potential non-compliance issues either during or after their customer onboarding processes could ultimately impact our compliance with economic sanctions and related laws. Finally, failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties.

In response to U.S. and European sanctions against Russia earlier this year, we saw increased information security threats from state sponsored actors. Other geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected or sympathizing jurisdictions or other actors, which could put our information and assets at risk, as well as result in network disruption. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">To date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However, future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems (including third-party provider systems) or devices that our customers use to access our integrated products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data information) or data security compromises. Such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added services), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties. In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers, other stakeholders and the broader payments ecosystem, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. These consequences could be further pronounced in jurisdictions in which we are deemed critical national infrastructure. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Despite various mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future, or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payments and technology industries, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and account holders when and how they want to be served, our global presence, our extensive use of third-party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="height:54pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:right"><span><br/></span></div><div style="text-align:right"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">MASTERCARD 2022 FORM 10-K </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">33</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:54pt;width:100%"><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#ff671b;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">PART I</span></div><div><span style="color:#ff671b;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">ITEM 1A.

Further events of this type may subject us to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands. Damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services. Such events could also slow or reverse the trend toward electronic payments. In addition to reputational concerns, the cumulative impact of multiple account data compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such events by, among other things, making it more difficult to identify consumers. Moreover, while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could still face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could reduce our operational resilience and materially affect our overall business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Our transaction switching systems and other offerings have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions, fire, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events (including those related to climate change). Our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists, activists, or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities and/or systems. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets. If one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Although we maintain an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks, because of the intrinsic importance of our switching systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff671b;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Stakeholder Relationships</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Many of our customer relationships are not exclusive.

In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors. Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned.

These consolidations have included customers with a substantial Mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor. If significant consolidation among customers were to continue, it could result in the substantial loss of business for us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects. In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business. Consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers. These developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and, in many jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">While we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system, including merchants, governments, fintechs and large digital companies and other technology companies, we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers&#8217; success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See our risk factor in &#8220;Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations for further discussion.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">With the exception of the United States and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus cards are authorized, cleared and settled by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries and do not, as described above, have direct relationships with account holders, we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Merchants&#8217; continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Merchants are important constituents in our payments system. We rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase revenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence that we believe are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations. Some merchants are increasingly asking regulators to review and potentially regulate our own network fees, in addition to interchange. See our risk factor in &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Other Regulation&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry regulation, including interchange fees.

We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-branded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives.

In some cases, our brand may not be featured in the payment solution or may be secondary to other brands. Additionally, as part of our relationships with some issuers, our payment brand is only included on the back of the card. As a result, our brand may either be invisible to consumers or may not be the primary brand with which consumers associate the payment experience.

Our inability to meet candidate demands has led in recent years, and may continue to lead, to an increase in declined offers. In addition, high inflation has impacted both cost structure and employee demand for wage growth, which may lead to talent attrition. Moreover, changes in and enforcement of immigration and work permit laws and visa regulations have made it difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions where we operate, potentially impairing our ability to attract and retain talent. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the influence of work flexibility on candidate decisions, we have adapted our policies and practices to allow for flexible team-driven work arrangements (including both remote and hybrid).

Currently, Mastercard Foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of Class A common stock prior to May 1, 2027, except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements, for which purpose earlier sales are permitted and have occurred. Based on that timing, Mastercard Foundation would be permitted to sell all of its remaining shares beginning May 1, 2027, subject to certain conditions. The directors of Mastercard Foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers. The ownership of Class A common stock by Mastercard Foundation, together with the restrictions on transfer, could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the Class A common stock. In addition, because Mastercard Foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time, it may not have the same interest in short or medium-term movements in our stock price as, or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to, our other stockholders. </span></div>
