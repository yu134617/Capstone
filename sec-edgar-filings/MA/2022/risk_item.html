New regulations and oversight could also relate to our clearing and settlement activities (including risk management policies and procedures, collateral requirements, participant default policies and procedures, the ability to complete timely switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resource requirements). Several jurisdictions have also inquired about the network fees we charge to our customers (typically as part of broader market reviews of retail payments). In addition, several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry. In several jurisdictions, we have been designated as a &#8220;systemically important payment system&#8221;, and other regulators are considering designating us as systemically important or in a similar category resulting in heightened regulatory oversight. These obligations, designations and restrictions may further expand and could conflict with each other as more jurisdictions impose oversight of payments systems. Moreover, as regulators around the world increasingly look to replicate similar regulation of payments and other industries, efforts in any one jurisdiction may influence approaches in other jurisdictions. Similarly, new initiatives within a jurisdiction involving one product may lead to regulation of similar or related products (for example, debit regulations could lead to regulation of credit products). As a result, the risks to our business created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involve other products within any particular jurisdiction. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">The expansion of our products and services as part of our multi-rail strategy have also created the need for us to obtain new types and increasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those imposed on our core network activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer licenses to support certain activities. These licenses typically impose supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital, safeguarding, risk management and other business obligations. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Increased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our products and services, have resulted and may continue to result in costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. As a result, issuers, acquirers and other customers could be less willing to participate in our payments system and/or use our other products or services, reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products (making our products less desirable to consumers), reduce the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions or other operational metrics, disintermediate us, impact our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services, all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, any regulation that is enacted related to the type and level of network fees we charge our customers could also materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for changes to our system rules, procedures or operations, or could require customization with regard to such changes, which could negatively impact us. Such changes could lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system by financial institutions or other customers. Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Increased regulatory, legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of our products. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products. If interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our products or route transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoting our integrated products and services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates on balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Governments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation, competition law, central bank regulation and litigation.

These and other impacts could lower transaction volumes, and/or make proprietary three-party networks or other forms of payment more attractive.

These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error or accidental technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malicious code (including ransomware), phishing attacks or information security breaches and could lead to the misappropriation of consumer account and other information and identity theft. The advent of the global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant rise in these types of threats due to a significant portion of our workforce working from home in a mostly remote environment.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information and technology in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. Our customers and other parties in the payments value chain, as well as account holders, rely on our digital technologies, computer systems, software and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our integrated products and services, our customers and account holders increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control. We, like other financial technology organizations, routinely are subject to cyber-threats and our technologies, systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers, have been subject to attempted cyber-attacks. Because of our position in the payments value chain, we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks. Additionally, geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">To date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However, future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems (including third-party provider systems) or devices that our customers use to access our integrated products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data information) or data security compromises. Such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added services), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties. In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Despite various mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future, or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payments and technology industries, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and account holders when and how they want to be served, our global presence, our extensive use of third-party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">In addition to information security risks for our systems, we also routinely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transaction data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of account holders. Further events of this type may subject us to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands.

Moreover, while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could still face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

Our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists, activists, or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities and/or systems. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets. If one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Although we maintain a enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks, because of the intrinsic importance of our switching systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff671b;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Stakeholder Relationships</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Many of our customer relationships are not exclusive.

In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors. Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned. A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Consolidation amongst our customers could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Our customers&#8217; industries have undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation in the past.

In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business. Consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers.

Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers&#8217; success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk.

Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries and do not, as described above, have direct relationships with account holders, we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Merchants&#8217; continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Merchants are important constituents in our payments system.

We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase revenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence. We believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations. Some merchants are increasingly asking regulators to review and potentially regulate our own network fees, in addition to interchange. See our risk factor in &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Other Regulation&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry regulation, including interchange fees.

We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-branded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives.

Revenue from switching cross-border and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of cross-border travel and our customers&#8217; need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. Cross-border activity has, and may continue to be, adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, health, weather and other conditions. These include COVID-19, as well as the threat of terrorism and separate outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of which could result in future epidemics or pandemics), as well as major environmental and extreme weather events, including those related to climate change. As governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressure to address climate change and other sustainability matters, these stakeholders may express new expectations, focus investments and require additional disclosures in ways that cause significant shifts in commerce and consumption behaviors. The impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these events or factors could ultimately decrease cross-border activity. Additionally, any regulation of interregional interchange fees could also negatively impact our cross-border activity.

This revenue (and the related expense) could be transacted in a non-functional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income.

The ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry. Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers, merchants or other organizations that impact the perception of our brands or the payments industry in general. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as &#8220;predatory&#8221;. Moreover, adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers or other companies and organizations that use our products and services (including certain legally permissible but high- risk merchant categories, such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms and adult content) may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater public, regulatory or legislative scrutiny. We have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace. Under some circumstances, our use of social media, or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes, could also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us, our products or merchants or other end users who utilize our products. To the extent any of our published sustainability metrics are subsequently viewed as inaccurate or we are unable to execute on our sustainability initiatives, we may be viewed negatively by consumers, investors and other stakeholders concerned about these matters. Also, as we are headquartered in the United States, a negative perception of the United States could impact the perception of our company, which could adversely affect our business. Any of the above issues could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:130%">Lack of visibility of our brand in our products and services, or in the products and services of our partners who use our technology, may materially and adversely affect our business. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">As more players enter the global payments ecosystem, the layers between our brand and consumers and merchants increase. In order to compete with other powerful consumer brands that are also becoming part of the consumer payment experience, we often partner with those brands on payment solutions. These brands include large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers and use our networks to build their own acceptance brands. In some cases, our brand may not be featured in the payment solution or may be secondary to other brands. Additionally, as part of our relationships with some issuers, our payment brand is only included on the back of the card. As a result, our brand may either be invisible to consumers or may not be the primary brand with which consumers associate the payment experience.

We may be unable to retain or to attract highly qualified employees. The market for key personnel is highly competitive, particularly in technology and other skill areas significant to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and visa regulations and related enforcement have made it difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Moreover, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our workforce is working in either a remote or hybrid environment. Such environments may continue after the pandemic due to potential resulting trends, and could impact the quality of our corporate culture, as well as our ability to attract and retain talent. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork could harm our overall business and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">We rely on key personnel to lead with integrity and decency.

As we do so, we face increasing regulatory scrutiny with respect to antitrust and other considerations that could impact these efforts. We also face competition for acquisition targets due to the nature of the market for technology companies. As a result, we could be prevented from successfully completing such acquisitions in the future. If we are not successful in these efforts, we could lose strategic opportunities that are dependent, in part, on inorganic growth. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">To the extent we do make these acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them, despite original intentions and focused efforts. In addition, such an integration may divert management&#8217;s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Moreover, we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations, including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:130%">Any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations, both directly as a result of the new business as well as in the other existing parts of our business, with which we would need to comply. This compliance could increase our costs, and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements. Additionally, targets that we acquire may have data practices that do not initially conform to our privacy and data protection standards and data governance model, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.
